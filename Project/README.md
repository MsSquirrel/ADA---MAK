# Amazon cellphones evaluation platform 

# Abstract
When you want to buy a new phone on Amazon, you start to read all the reviews, and you might be a bit confused at the end. You don't have a nice idea on which caracteristics are nice, and which are bad.
We dedide to make a platform evaluation based on Amazon reviews to extract the most revelant topics (things people talk in the reviews like battery, ergonomy, ...) from the reviews and perform a sentiment analysis on the words to grade them, in order to clear your head and to feel better when you shop online.

# Research questions
What is mentioned in reviews for each models ? (caracteristics)
Which are the downsides of specific models based on the reviews ?
Price compared to "cacultated quality" (create groups?)
Time of the reviews is also important. If there is time left, we could discuss if some models tend to improve ?
Which machine learning techniques we will use for this project ?

# Dataset
Amazon dataset (cell phones)
Additional web scraping from Amazon if required

# A list of internal milestones up until project milestone 2
- Have a project notebook with descriptive analysis
- Understand the data
- Preprocess reviews with sentiment analysis
- Try ML algorithms
- Think about the final result (how to show our results, data story ?)

# Questions for TAa
Which machine learning techniques we will use for this project ?
Which libraries are we allowed to use ?
