      "I didn't buy from this seller, but I owned this phone when it first came out.  It is by far one of the best cell phones I've ever owned.  It has great reception, the sound quality is superb, and is very very sturdy.  My phone was dropped down the stairs, dropped in a puddle, left out in the sun at the beach where little grains of sand got everywhere and it functioned just fine.  The material it's made of is really tough and doesn't scratch easily if you take care not to drop it often.  The only problem I found with this phone is that it has a really poor camera and tiny screen.  Everything else was above par.  Hope this helps!  :)\n",

      "This phone rocks! First, it has an unbelievable signal wherever I go. I never have a problem connecting. Also, it is incredibly clear. I can hear the caller and they can hear me. Unlike those \"candy bar\" type phones, this one wraps around your face so you talk directly into the microphone and the person on the other end can hear every word you speak and not hear all of the background noise. I don't know if it has some sort of sound filter on it or not, but it sure sounds great to the person on the other end.Another cool this is how light and thin it is. You barely even notice that it's in your pocket. But the vibrate on this phone is very strong, so you know when you're getting a call.Last, this is an UNLOCKED phone. This is a big deal, since you can hop carriers and not have to switch phones. Also, very cool to have an unlocked phone when you go out of the country and want to make local calls in that country. Just buy a starter package abroad [usually about $10 USD] and make local calls until you use up the card. Way cheaper than trying to make calls using your US carrier.I love this phone!\n",

It does everything it says it does and is small enough and sturdy enough that cramming it in your back pants pocket is easy. So if you expect it to do only what it advertises then you'll be fine. Just consider exactly what you want from your phone and research accordingly.I have only one problem and it won't be a doozy until further into the season.

      "I got this phone from AT&T and started a contract with then. They are wonderful, customer service has been wonderful and this awesome user friendly phone died after 3.5 months.  I was so upset so before sending it to motorola for warranty repair, i went on ebay to buy another one.  Listing said \"new\"....I removed my sim card from my dead RAZR and shipped it to motorola.  I receive my \"new unlocked\" razr and put my sim card in.....Nothing was there! An error code popped up and the date in the phone was for 2004...hmmm, I call customer svc and they look up error code on the internet since they said this number was not an AT&T code so long story short it was a TMOBILE code and this phone must have been 4 yr old maybe refurbished.  After about 4 hours of phone chat with approx 7 different tech people, we determinted that i've lost all my sim info....why? who knows, we also determined that since i'm not able to receive pics or send any, that this phone's codes do not match the already preprogrammed AT&T razr phone codes.  TIP- IF YOU BREAK A PHONE, ESPECIALLY  AN AT&T ONE, MAKE SURE THAT YOUR NEXT ONE PURCHASED FROM A SELLER HERE OR EBAY IS ALSO WITH/FROM THE SAME PROVIDER.  I AM NOW RETURNING THIS RAZR BACK TO THE SELLER and getting a new one that IS AN AT&T phone with the proper codes already installed.  ANOTHER TIP- THE RAZR THAT DIED AND WAS SHIPPED TO MOTOROLA HAD A TON OF PICS IN IT.  THIS IS NOT SAVED TO YOUR SIM, EVERYONE WILL BE ABLE TO SEE YOUR PICS AND YOU WILL PROBABLY NOT HAVE THEM WHEN THE PHONE IS RETURNED TO YOU.  I am looking forward to my new razr, the AT&T specific one and when my original one is returned (from the warranty work) i will have an extra one for back up.  This is a user friendly phone, not heavy duty, rather dainty so be careful with it...mine broke right in the hinge pin and never powered on again.  Over all, i love the phone.  Just hope to have better luck with the next one, keep yours in a good protected case.\n",

      "Well, I've had my V3 Razr for about 2 years. In that time, it's been unusually trouble free. Okay, once or twice, it has freaked out with a whitescreen but I attribute this to heavy use and some cheap aftermarket batteries.The good: Yes, it's sleek and pretty. It's well built. It's packs away in a vestpocket. The range beats most other phones in my area--I get more bars than anybody I know in concrete buildings and I actually live in one.It has the features I need: bluetooth, speaker phone, conference call, etc. And a few features I don't need: camera--I'm a very small investor and I'm not Steven Spielberg. Still, I keep a foto of my family as a background screen--it's a nice touch.At 95 bucks, you can't top the price for this kind of quality. I paid $250 for my current V3 Razr when I bought it overseas. And I'm buying a second phone as backup and to take advantage of the commonality of all the accessories I now have. Plus, my wife is eying my current Razr rather hungrily and she'll probably wrench it from me before too long, anyway.The bad: Battery life is only fair; I get a full day in my home office with 3+ hours of calls and most of those bluetoothed for handsfree action. But you have to expect to recharge nightly. Even moderate use of an hour or so necessitates a nightly recharge. I can live with this. I just can't afford to have my phone fail on an important call. So I charge it daily. Often, it's on the recharger at work while I use my bluetooth headset. This works for me. It's always ready to go when I am.Hey, I consider 3+ hours of use to be a serious workload for any cell phone. It's really not fair to beat on your phone on a daily basis and then complain about its performance.For the benefit of those worried about the warranty, well, I live abroad. The Razr is a very popular model. There are numerous service centers with people skilled in the repair this phone. If it's not up to snuff when you open it on day one--send it back to Amazon on their 30 day return policy.But if it works fine, then rest assured it's no big deal to get service for it in any large city abroad or in the U.S.I give it 4 stars for all of the above reasons. To me, the good outweighs the bad. I don't need a ton of features. Just a few that work consistently. And I have 2 years of mostly heavy but trouble-free use so far. Hey, the best endorsement I can give is the fact that I just bought another one.\n",

Phone 2 was dropped or got in water (teen son) and died.

Out of nowhere, when I turned it on all I got was a black screen that was a Bootloader screen that gave software versions, and said I needed to program it and connect a USB data cable.  Sounds  do-able, but no go.  I've searched everywhere, I've taken the phone to various phone guru repair people, and no one can do anything with it.  They are guessing that the internals (ROM perhaps) is corrupted, or some such, but the bottom line is that nothing can apparently get it going agian.  I've emailed Motorola with all the relevant information, but frankly, I don't expect to hear back from them.  If I do get useful info one way or the other, I'll note it on this review later.Meanwhile, I wouldn't really advise buying a used Razr because it's a real roll of the dice at this point, and just know that if you have issues with what you buy, the likelihood of fixing it seems to be less than zero.\n",

      "Prior to buying my phone, i got a lot of really bad feedback - from my husband, sister and friends.  They kept telling me that V3's limited features are not worth my money and that I would be better off sticking to my trusty Nokia phone.  Besides that, they said that a Motorola is not very user-friendly.I conditioned myself to thinking that I will not complain about the limited features of a V3 only because I really wanted to have one so badly (because of its stylish appearance and size). I did buy a V3 despite my husband's objections and was surprised to find that the V3 is more than just a basic phone!! It has some features that I initially did not expect it to have.  You just need to read the manual and tinker with the phone to unlock your phone's potentials.  Another surprise, my black edition V3 is able to CAPTURE, and not just play, videos....Most of V3's functions are a lot similar to my Nokia phone, so I didn't have to make a lot of adjustments getting used to the V3.  You can even tailor the buttons/assign functions to keypads according to your preference.The only thing I think Motorola should've done is to have copied Nokia's technology in terms of browsing the phonebook/directory.  With the V3, you need to go through each person in your phonebook on a per alphabet basis to find a specific number.  With the Nokia, if you want to skip some names that start with the same alphabet letter, you simply key in the next letter in the person's name so you get less names to scan through.Also, it's a pity that my battery's life is so short - it lasts only about 2-3 days with minimal usage.Also, it would've been nice for my phone to have an infrared capability, although with the bluetooth technology, I guess I could live without the infrared.Overall though, my Motorola V3 is such a joy to behold!!\n",

      "I bought this RAZR v3 phone in July to go with my 7-Eleven Speak Out Wireless prepaid service.  The phone I received from Amazon.com was made for the Hong Kong market, so it came with a outlet plug adapter for U.S. customers.  (The AC adapter itself is universal voltage, and the slim paper manual is in English.)  The phone is quadband and fully unlocked, so it can be used anywhere in the world.I really like the RAZR phone.  It's very solid and the voice quality is excellent.  Speak Out Wireless runs on AT&T; and T-Mobile networks so the reception quality can vary, but overall the RAZR does an excellent job in pulling in as much signal as possible.  As with other Moto phones, the brightness of the screen can be adjusted, and the ringer type and volume can be easily changed.  The metallic keypad takes a little getting used to, but is pretty comfy to use.The camera is only VGA but takes good-quality pictures when there's plenty of light.  Video capture is jerky and limited to 15 seconds, so that's probably the weakest feature for me.  Bluetooth linkup to a Sony Ericsson earpiece works fine.  Battery life is admirable; I don't use the phone much, maybe just 10 minutes a week, and I need to recharge it once every 8 days or so.Because I've owned many Moto's before so I like the RAZR's interface, since it feels familiar, but I can understand how it can confuse users new to the Moto scene.  Overall, though, I don't think it's harder to use than a Sony or Nokia.What really impresses me is the build quality of this phone.  Nowhere can you find out where this thing is made, but the material and fit and finish are excellent.  I'm very happy with this inexpensive purchase.\n",

      "I've gone through a number of Nokia, Ericsson and LG phones, but I have never enjoyed a phone as much at my RAZR.It is thin enough to carry in my front pocket, but big enough to hold comfortably while talking.  I like the look, it has a decent camera, bluetooth, a sensible plug (unlike my Nokias), the battery life has been excellent.  It is generally a convenient, well designed phone.  This alone makes it worth a recommendation.  But the reason I really love this phone, and the reason you should seriously consider it -- it is rugged and extremely well built.I was at the top of a four story open stairwell, as I pulled it from my pocket I clumsily dropped it over the rail.  It fell cleanly down the center of the stairwell - I'm guessing over 45 feet - and cracked against the hard concrete floor.  I rushed down to get it, knowing nothing could survive a fall like that, and found it working like nothing happened.  Not only does it still work great - it didn't even get scratched or dinged by the fall.  I know enough about physics to be completely baffled.I have no idea how they can make such a thin, refined phone so darn rugged, but thanks to the Motorola's engineers and factory for putting together such a high quality product.\n",

I had dropped it on hard surfaces a few times with no problem, but it wasn't until last week that I found out how truly tough this phone is.  I accidentally left it in the pocket of my pants.  It went into the wash, 40 minutes underwater with agitator and even a second rinse cycle.  Then it went into the dryer undetected, and spent about an hour and twenty minutes banging around on high heat.  When I pulled the pants out of the dryer and felt the phone in the pocket, I groaned and figured I was out a phone.  Being optimistic, I removed the battery and left the case open until I returned from work.  The battery, of course, was shot; but when I put the battery from my wife's Razor in it and pressed the ON button, it acted like nothing had ever happened.  Worked perfectly, even with water still behind the LCD screen.  The water eventually dried out, and I'm still using the phone with no problem.

      "This is a great phone, rugged, simple and well-built \"flip-phone\" -- just what I was looking for. It is, however, an older model and the photo and video specs are really not up to the quality of modern phones. I don't really care about taking photos and video, so that's not a problem for me. It is \"new\" and came in the original box, but I did have to purchase a new battery. Lithium batteries have a limited shelf life, even if they have not been used, and this one would not take or hold a charge.After using this phone for a month, I am finding that this phone is a battery killer. Even on standby, and making no calls, it will run the battery down to nothing in about 8-10 hours. I live only a few blocks from a cell tower, and my old phone would last for days on a charge. Have purchased 2 new batteries (Motorola), charged them according directions -- with the same results. Not sure what the problem is with this phone.\n",

The v66 was a little better, but the Motorola menu had to be the worst of any phone I had ever used. My v600 was a very pleasant surprise. My sleek and functional RAZR is the best phone that I have owned. I really like the large crisp screen. The tiny external screen is a great addition. After three weeks of fairly heavy use, I haven't had any problems. The RAZR has pretty good talk time, but I'm not certain whether or not one can really get the 7 hours claimed by Motorola. The feature that I really like and appreciate is the abilit to charge my phone with a standard USB cable.

Screen came clean off. I called her, clicked the speaker phone button, and it still. frickin. worked.

      "It is both stylish and functional. Black by far is the best color. Great reception and worth the price. The only problem with the phone is it is a fingerprint magnet but you can clean it. It is pretty durable i have dropped it three times and no scratches though i would recomened buying a case. Also beware of the bluetooth eats up your battery. The video quality is pretty good it can record up to a minute if ajusted. I recomend getting the Usb data cable and software for the phone so you can put your emails,data, etc. on your phone. In concluesion worth the buy.\n"

      "There are plenty of reviews of the RAZR V3 on its product pages as well as this one so I'll just review this specific product- the International Version that doesn't have a warranty.I was a little apprehensive about buying one of these without a warranty- and still am- except I did have the Amazon protection for a month.So far (45 days), this RAZR works as well as those I've owned in the past.I've only found two issues so far:1. I can't hear very well on it. It's OK, but just OK. Nowhere near as good as my SLVR or Walkman.2. There are more dropout areas and some areas where reception is weaker than my other phones.But then, it seems like this was typical of my previous RAZRs.All-in-all, especially considering the price, and the fact that it is unlocked makes this a pretty good deal as long as nothing goes wrong with it.Of course, I paid less than the present price and there were no other options like there are now. For instance, Amazon is presently offering the US version RAZR in blue WITH a warranty for $5 less as well as the International SLVR L7 with no warranty, which I would have preferred if it had been available at the time, for under $75.00. (Both are listed on this page as items customers ultimately buy after viewing this item).I hope this helps for this particular item.\n",

      "The Black RAZR V3 is the wireless phone I have always wanted.  It's that simple.Before having bought mine, I would read commentary from people who would cite all of the features the RAZR doesn't have:  \"I could buy the (insert model number of cheaper, but still expensive phone which does 100 different things--all of them poorly) and get more for a lot less money.\"  When I would research a model recommended by these self-proclaimed gadget freaks, I'd find that it's dimensions make keeping it in a pocket an awkward and uncomfortable proposition; I'd find that the pictures it takes are not nearly of comparable quality to those taken by even a modest digital camera; I'd  find that the lo-res video it can shoot serves no practical purpose;  I'd find that web-browsing, game-playing, Instant messaging, streaming television content, all suck up battery-life and ultimately make the device useless for the unlikely purpose of placing and taking phone calls; I'd find that the phone casing is composed of cheap and flimsy plastics which make me wonder how long it wll last; I'd find that little attention had been paid to how the phone's design will contribute to, or detract from, user comfort.  After my investigation, I concluded that for all the money I would save by buying \"Phone X\" over buying a RAZR, I would still have paid hundreds too much for a filmsy hunk of cutting-edge technojunk.  (Don't take my word for it.  Look around on the Net for comments about the RAZR around the time of its inroduction and see the recommendations from consumers that people choose the Motorola V600 instead.  Then look at the consumer reviews of the V600 on this site.)The RAZR has a camera, a web-browser, Instant messaging capability, and a whole array of other features all of which are listed in the product description.  To the extent that the RAZR does these things adequately I will offer little, if any, comment--mainly because I don't care about them.  That to which I can and will attest is that the RAZR exceeds my expectation on how it serves AS A PHONE.Using my own criteria, a wireless phone should draw and hold a signal; It's earpiece should deliver clear sound at a volume which can compete with background noise; it's mouthpiece should pick up the users voice clearly; it should be compact enough to allow for placement in clothing pockets without creating prominent bulges; it should be solidly built out of durable materials which are not prone to scratching; it should have decent battery life.  And yes, anything for which I pay hundreds of dollars should be designed with aesthetics in mind: there are far too many wireless phones which look like disposable children's toys, or like awkward, all-purpose, button-riddled gadgets.Using the above criteria, the RAZR V3, particularly the Black model, is close to perfect.  The sound from the ear piece could certainly be louder, but I have yet to have a caller's voice drowned out by the noise of busy New York City streets.  The people to whom I'm speaking have reported to have heard my voice loudly and clearly.  Battery life could be longer, but then, the same could be said about many wireless phones which are bulkier and have larger batteries.  I have used the phone on both T-Mobile and Cingular networks and found that it draws a strong signal on both; it has never dropped a call.  I found the speaker phone to be loud and clear despite my expectations to the contrary.  Is the much-lamented Motorola phone book program clunky?  Yes it is.  But the RAZR's voice-dialing works well, making it possible to avoid scrolling through the phone book if one hates it that much.I'll try to boil it down with a somewhat clumsy analogy: Complaining that the RAZR doesn't do enough in the way of tech-gimmicks to justify its price (which is considerably lower that it was when it was introduced) is like complaining that an exotic sports car isn't worth the money because it doesn't have a cup holder, a GPS system, and DVD player like the Minivan you've been looking to buy.  That ridiculousness ignores the engineering that makes the sports car a superior performer on the road, and the attention put toward making it sleek and aesthetically pleasing.  The RAZR's performance has made concern over signal strength a thing of the past. and its design is unmatched--not just for it's ultra-compactness, but for the solidity of it's build.  That makes it worth what I paid for it.  And my inability to speak to the quality of other phones on the market put them out of consideration.Besides, as they say, black is beautiful.That the RAZR cannot serve as a business-card scanner doesn't trouble me.  For those who need to have whichever feature-laden mobile gadget is most desired at the moment, buy a Samsung MM-A800, clip it on you belt (you'll need to), and earn yourself the right to say your phone can do just about everything--poorly.\n",

      "I have had this phone for almost two years now and I like it very much. My wife got a Nokia 6102 that needed to be replaced. I can now get a new phone almost for free, but I do not see a reason to get a new one. It has better reception than the Nokia, the call quality is better; it is louder, and much thinner and sturdier.  The battery life is quite good, even after two years of use. I charge it every 5-7 days or so and use it during the day only. A big plus is that you can rearrange the icons so that it will be harder to accidentally access the web and get charged for it. The Nokia and the Samsung SYNC intentionally make that too easy; the SYNC is the worst in that respect. The only thing that is not that great is that the screen is hardly visible in bright sunlight. The SYNC has brighter screen. On the other hand, my RAZR is a two year old model; maybe the newer ones have better screens.Update: 5 years later, the phone is working great. It served me for 7 years and I will be sad when it goes. The call quality is better than any smart phone that I tried.\n",

      "First of all let me say that I did not purchase my RAZR from Amazon. I purchased my phone from my local Cingular store. I have wanted one of these phones since they first came out. Here is a breakdown of my opinion of the phone:PROS:*Thin, elegent looking phone. When the phone is opened it really is amazing how thin it is.*Suprisingly durable. Despite the fact that it is so thin, it is relatively hardy. I thought it would be easy to break (especially when open) but it is a sturdy little phone.*Large, vivid screen. The inside screen is quite large and images, menus, colors, etc. show up very well. (As with all cell phones, it is harder to see in bright daylight though.) Outside screen convenient.*Speaker phone is better than on other phones I've had (mostly I've had Samsung).*It is a desired phone, and every time I get my phone out someone makes a comment about it.*Some other reviews have mentioned problems with the volume of calls, and that menus are clumsy. I disagree with this. I have not had any problems with either of these. As a matter of fact, I like that you can rearrange pretty much any of the menus you want to. Placing what you use most at the top of the page and what you use least at the bottom. I have also not had problems with dropped calls.CONS:*Outside screen does not display time in such a manner that is easy to see when the phone is not in use (you must push one of the side buttons or open the phone to light up the outside screen).*As mentioned in other reviews, the phone collects fingerprints and oils from your skin very easily. I have to wipe off the screen and buttons every single time I use it. Especially if I have on makeup when I use it.*Twice since I have had the phone (I've had it close to a year) it has just shut down on me. The so-called \"white screen of death\" I suppose. Luckily a cold restart (taking out the battery for 10 seconds and then turning the phone back on) solved the problem.THE ONE REAL PROBLEM:The only thing that was frustrating to me about this phone is that within a few weeks of getting the phone I started to notice sone dust collecting under the main inside screen. Over time more and more collected. Within 3 months, the whole bottom right corner was just covered in dust and it was maddening. And there was nothing you could do about it since it was underneath the screen. Luckily my phone was under warranty, so Cingular replaced it for me. Would you believe the new one they sent me did the SAME THING! Actually it collected dust faster then the first one I'd had. Feeling quite frustrated, I called customer service again, and the sent me ANOTHER phone. Luckily this time no dust collected under the screen. I've had this last replacement now for 8-9 months and haven't had the problem again.Overall, I really have loved my RAZR. Once I got the dust problem resolved, I have had no other complaints. I would recommend that if you purchase this phone, make sure you also get a warranty, and watch closely for dust accumulation. If you don't experience that problem, I hope you enjoy this phone as much as I have.\n",

      "I work with cell phones all day, so I see a lot of cool phones out there.  This phone, while not the top of the line, is certainly a solid phone with a crisp, if low, sound.  It's pretty comparable to the SLVR, which I had before this phone.  (The SLVR's display cracked.)Like other reviewers have probably mentioned, it is a little wider compared to even the other members of the Motorola line (such as the KRZR or the SLVR), and I have to admit it felt a little delicate compared to the candybar phone - it's probably just my experience using chunkier phones.  I equate this phone to the Corolla of phones - it's a solid phone, nice little perks, a lot of people have them, but not the top of the line.I received a British English version of the phone, which is perfectly fine with me, and unlike phones sold in the US, it has a number of different languages available on the phone.  (This is a huge perk for me, as most phones in the US only display English/French/Spanish and maybe Portuguese, but the version I received had French, Arabic, German, Russian, Spanish, and Turkish language support.)Pros:- Slimline casing- Proven and popular design- Widely available accessories- Excellent Bluetooth support - buttons are in no danger of being pushed while in handsfree mode if the phone is closed- Wide keys with raised ridges- Unlocked - can be used with any available GSM SIM - even in other countries- Does not support as many low frequencies as Nokia (which gives a clearer talking sound)- Decent speakerphone technology (but not perfect)Cons:- BREW OS - harder to get applications from the computer to the phone- Does not come with Motorola synchronization software- Older OS and less feature-rich than newer phones, even later versions of the RAZR line.- Web key a part of the dialing pad, right above the call key - be careful not to hit it if you don't have a data plan- Low audio signal sometimes - can be very quiet in a high-noise situation.Matter of Opinion:- Motorola menuing system - please note that this system is NOT the one used by U.S. carriers, which normally flashes their own branded menuing system onto the phone (like Verizon).\n",

      "I purchased this phone from Amazon aware that a lot of variability exists regarding the opinions of other purchasers. However, I have owned a Razr V3 phone for several years with no problems. I am very gratified that the phone I received was everything I desired. The phone worked flawlessly while I was in Europe. I also used the Modal sim card that Amazon provided free with the phone and the reception was superb with regard to my calls as well to my incoming calls.I was particularly impressed with the high quality of the aluminum casing of this phone, much better than my domestic Razr V3, which has a plastic casing. I dropped it a couple of times with no damage or problems. It is a sturdy cell phone. While it is designed as a European cell phone, it can be set for either a 24 hour clock or the English/US 12 hour am/pm time format. The supplied battery also worked well, and I often went several days before recharging it. My phone came with an English manual and an US charging unit. All in all, an excellent international phone. I just purchased another one to replace my plastic \"domestic\" Razr V3 phone.\n",

      "Overall: Great phone with good organizer features and messaging. Excellent form factor and innovative keyboard is very easy to use. Build quality seems very good, although the first one I received had a \"Back\" button that did not work, a manufacturing flaw. The replacement arrived overnight and is fine.Pros- Excellent call quality. First and foremost, the M600 works very well as a phone. I am on T-Mobile.- NO CAMERA. This was a primary factor for me, as I cannot have a camera phone at work.- Great form factor. Unlike a lot of Pocket PC phones, this one is small enough to carry easily.- Multiple input methods. You can use the \"rocker\" keyboard, which works great, the pop up virtual keyboard, or character recognition. I think that only Sony-Ericsson is still doing character recognition - you simply write on the screen with the stylus and the program types the letters. Way cool. What is a \"rocker\" keyboard? Well, it's not anything to do with rock-and-roll! Each key has two letters on it, and you push one side or the other to get that particular letter. An \"ALT\" key supports alternate letters above the normal ones. It is very fast once one becomes accustomed to the letter positions.- Cool interface. Obviously, the UIQ 3 operating system takes some getting used to, especially after a Pocket PC device. But it looks good and works well. Be prepared for a learning curve. For example, dialing a number is as easy and pushing the numbers - there is not phone \"application\" such as one finds in the Pocket PC Phone world. However, this is only possible one the main \"Standby\" screen. In general, this device seems more \"thought out\" and \"integrated\" than a PPC. Consider it more of a MAC than a PC.- Excellent support. Sony Ericsson has a way to send a text message to configure the internet options on the phone. Very painless. It was equally simple to update to the latest firmware. If you get this phone, be sure and get the latest firmware - it allows one to eliminate menu animation, which makes the OS much faster at rendering the menu screens.- Great battery life. I get 2  to 3 days of normal use. My old PPC got two days at best.- Support for Java programs.- Touch screen, which is unusual in a smart phone. Only some games support this feature, but I found a great bowling and pool application that work with the stylus.- The included games are pretty good, especially the Golf game.- Includes programs to view and (sometimes) edit Word, Excel, and Powerpoint documents, as well as a PDF reader. The feature set is somewhat limited in Excel, and I actually had to change some formulas in one of my spreadsheets in order to get it to edit on the device. It definitely won't do any database statistical functions. If the Excel reader doesn't support any of the formulae in the spreadsheet, it only opens in a \"viewer\" mode, with no editing possible. For those with a need for complex Excel or Word documents, there is no better device than a PPC - naturally, since MS makes Windows Mobile 5 and MS Office. But the included programs work well enough. There is also a $50 program called \"Documents to Go\" that has better support, including database Excel functions. I ended up forking over the bucks for this program, and it has been worth the money.- Includes support for \"push\" email (like a Blackberry). I do not use the phone for corporate purposes, so I haven't used this feature. It is a separate program that has to be installed.- Supports POP, IMAP, and SMTP authentication. The inbox will store message headers forever until they are deleted from the server. Once they are deleted on the server (typically by your PC email program), the next time the M600 synchronizes email it will remove the headers. If you download a message there is an option to \"delete locally\", which deletes the body - but still leaves the header. If you delete the header, it deletes the email on the server. This takes some getting used to. You can schedule periodic automatic email checks separately for each inbox.- Supports both text messages and Multimedia Messaging (MMS).- Supports a 2 Mb Memory Stick Micro card, to store plenty of data or music. The card is hot-swappable, on the outside of the phone.- Integrated video and music player, plus software to transfer songs to the phone. Supports DRM (which can be considered either good or bad).- Includes backup software to allow one to back up the phones memory to the PC.- The phone will optionally charge from a USB cable if desired. I prefer to let the battery get to around 20% and then power the phone off and fully charge the battery. It charges very rapidly - around 1 hour or so. A wall charger (European with American adaptor) is included.- UMTS (high speed internet). This is a 2700 Mhz band used for high speed data in Europe only. BE SURE TO TURN OFF SEARCH FOR UMTS IF YOU ARE IN AMERICA - the UMTS search eats up a lot of battery. The phone can be set to only search for GPRS, which is the slower protocol.- Includes Bluetooth support, including handsfree. The handsfree works VERY well.- Contacts can be added to one of nine quick dial buttons, and each contact can have multiple phone numbers and a photograph assigned, plus Email addresses and (in general) just about anything else that MS Outlook supports. Ringtones can be added from MP3 files stored on the phone.- Voice dialing and answering is fully supported, only in handsfree mode.Cons- Tri band. This phone does not support the 850 Mhz frequency used by Cingular (AT&T;). It works fine on the T-Mobile bands. However coverage will be best around interstates and large cities. Some people prefer the \"Quad Band\" phones, which will roam on more networks here in the US.- No WiFi capabilities.- NO CAMERA. I know, I already listed this as a \"Pro\" item, but many people want a camera on their phone. Not on this model! However, the upcoming Sony Ericsson P1 is the same form factor as this phone and includes both a camera and WiFi.- No EDGE support - only GPRS, which is slower. Think of it as a 28 baud modem, and that is the correct speed. However, WAP sites load fast enough using the built in browser, which loads smaller pictures of websites by default.- The voice dialing does not include \"character recognition\". This means that one has to go into each phone number and record the contact information exactly as one will say it to do hands-free dialing. Be aware that voice dialing only works with either the corded or BT handsfree attached.- No profiles. Most devices have (at least) built in profiles, or customizable profiles. Thus one could set the phone to \"handsfree profile\", and automatically turn on the BT, etc. This phone doesn't have this feature.- Unable to customize the main screen. In the M600 this is the \"standby\" screen, and the  only thing that can be customized is how much of the calendar and messaging one wants to display. One can change the five icons across the bottom, but that is it. Coming from the  PPC world of Windows Mobile 5, where the entire \"today\" screen can be optimized, this is a bit of a disappointment. No \"plug-ins\" allowed!- Relatively low memory. I have not run out of memory yet, but I am careful to close all applications after I use them. Like the PPC, this device will leave programs in memory, not actually close them. However, it is much simpler to close the programs than on the PPC. The device really should have come with 128 mb, like most of the competition.  Note again that the new P1 will have 128 mb of memory.- The included web browser (opera mini) basically uses up the entire memory of the device.- The device can occasionally lock up. I have had this happen while adding voice dialing to the contacts, and once when I tried to make a call while the phone was just finished with another call. In each case I recovered by turning the power off and on. It has only happened three times, which is way better than my old WM 5 PPC phone, which locked up and misbehaved all the time.- VERY tight battery cover. OK, this is a bit picky, and I know they are trying to get good tolerances in their construction, but the battery cover took a LOT of pressure to get off. I finally found that if you hold the phone upside down and use the right thumb at the base and the left thumb at the top of the battery cover, the cover can be removed - but it is still difficult. If you plan to switch batteries a lot, you might keep this in mind.- The SIM card fits under the battery cover, and is nearly impossible to get out without tweezers. This isn't too big an issue, since 1) you can't remove the battery cover anyway [little humor there], and 2) you seldom switch SIM cards anyway.- I synchronize my calendar with Outlook XP, and I found that my repeating annual appointments will duplicate in the phone and in Outlook if I connect the phone to the computer while Outlook is already running. So I have to be sure to close Outlook before connecting the phone. I had about 10 copies of everyone's birthday when I realized what was happening. Deleting them was, to say the least, very interesting. I ended up deleting a couple of birthdays entirely and re-entering them.Summary:If you are tired of large devices and MS nonsense, this phone is for you. You have to get to know the OS, and the whole point is that it ISN'T that customizable - but it is stable and dependable.\n",

      "Well, I selected this phone after buying my wife a 910i last Christmas and seeing how good it was, decided to drag myself in to the 21st century :)I wanted something a little smaller (previously had a T39m) and this unit is great, and suits my work profile as I cannot visit Customer sites with a Camera phone - this phone does NOT have one, and that's just what I need.Bought from Amazon and it DOES come with a QWERTY keyboard - so ignore the reviewer above who, unfortunately got a QWERTZ layout - (begs the question why not return it?).Anyway, I'm more than happy with it - it's a phone, organizer,web browser and email tool, all in one. Bluetooth and IR are extras I've not used yet - may get a headset sometime though.I use T-Mobile service, and for the $5.99 extra for T-Zones Web, you get access to email, and the FULL internet. Ok it's not blazing fast access like DSL or something... but good for quick web access when out and about. It has the Opera browser built in, and works very well.As it's tri-band (with one band being 900Mhz) I think it's limited to GSM services from T-Mobile, Cingular - now AT&T; -, Maybe Verizon?, and some of the Canadian carriers. Check your service carrier for compatibility, some use 850Mhz in the US.The touchscreen is easy to use. and the keys (whilst small) work really well. In fact I use these more than the stylus, though for web browsing you really use a combination of them both.The display is bright an crisp and really bright indoors (which you can control), though outside in bright sunlight the display tends to \"washout\" a little.One little \"issue\" to date, is that the updated synchronisation software from Sony Ericsson (v1.2.15) seems to blow away my laptop on occasion when removing the phone from an external CDS-60 cradle... That's the only reason it gets 4 out of 5 stars from me.\n",

I usually keep it in my front pocket with change and whatever else happens to be in there and after a year it doesn't have as single mark or scratch on it. I'm amazed.  It looks as new as the day I bought it.  Beyond its duribility its funtionality seems to be just as durable. I haven;t had a single issue with it.  Its easy to use, has eveything I need, and has been very reliable.  Some of the issues pointed out in previous views, like not being able to define multiple profiles or customise the main screen, lock up issues, etc have been addressed with new firmware releases.  And I have been able to run Blackberry Connect on it with great success to use it for my company email enterprise server and also push personal POP3 email out to it.  Even my companies security policy changes recently pushed to all BB users were not a problem.  I have nothing but good things to say, and I am very anal and super picky.

      "I really really love this phone. I fell in love with it from the first moment I saw it and had to have it immediately. I bought a unlocked black Rizr from Ebay as soon as I could. People advised me not to get one because they believed that the Razr was such a terrible phone, but never having had a Razr, I felt it was worth a try.*** The good ***- The phone is beautiful. The screen display is bright and vibrant. Wallpapers and photos that you upload to the phone look just as good on the phone as they do on your computer. Everywhere I go I get compliments about it, and my friends wish they had it. It's very slim and easily fits into my pocket.- It's pretty study. It doesn't seem like it would break easily. I actually accidentally dropped the phone onto a concrete floor the other day. No damage what-so-ever. Not even a scratch or a dent.- To me the phone is very functional. My service is Cingular (AT&T;) and it worked immediately when I put in my sim card. Setting up internet was a little bit of a challenge, but doing a little research online solved that problem. The phone slides up easily and all of the menus are easy to access. You can personalize the phone and assign buttons to whatever features you wish.- Texting is very quick and simple because of the iTap. The phone remembers words and phrases you type so it makes long messages less of a hassle to write.- There is a voice command feature that I just started tinkering with that is very cool. You press the voice command button on the side of the phone and you can have the phone call, lookup, or send a txt message or email to anyone in your address book. Or you can even just say a telephone number and it'll dial it for you. With the voice command function you can also tell the phone to pull up applications like the audio player, check batter power and signal strength.- The camera and video are easy to use. The camera has a high intensity flash and zooms in. The video camera is great as well. Extremely easy to use and fairly good quality with sound. With my 1GB micro SD card I can take exactly 1 hour of video or 1000 photos.I use a card reader and micro SD to upload things to my phone and it is so fast. As soon as the card is entered into the phone everything is immediately recognized. It's also a breeze to set your mp3s as ringtones. There is a voice recorder on the phone so you can record your own ringtones as well.- The phone has a couple of games loaded on it already, not really much into games, so I haven't played them. There are two music players: a Java player, and the phone's default player. Theres a calculator, date planner, alarm clock... standard features that you'd find on mostphones.- Battery life is wonderful. I have now gone 3 days without charging the phone and I still have 2 bars (out of three) left in battery life. I suppose it all depends on how much you use the phone for.** Things I don't like **- One word: FINGERPRINTS!! The screen is a fingerprint magnet and it drives me crazy. I actually keep an anti-static cloth with me so I can wipe the phone off when it gets bad.- The vibrate is a bit weak. Sometimes when it's in my pocket I don't even feel it, and there's no way to change the vibration strength.- The speaker phone isn't very loud, but I don't use it that often anyway.- The sound quality of the music and video isn't that great, but I really didn't expect it to be stellar.- The keys are a little hard to press and it's difficult to accurately dial numbers using the pads of your fingers sometimes. I have to use my fingernails to dial or text to keep from pressing the wrong key.But none of these flaws are serious enough for me to take away a star from this phone. The pros outweigh the cons by far. I absolutely love this phone, and if you're a fan of the slider type phones, I urge you to give the Rizr a try. I don't think you'll regret it!\n",

      "I have had this phone since August and I love it. I am constantly complimented on it and people are always curious about it. I have no problems using text messages (someone had said they did) There is a slot for a micro SD card inside the phone (I have a 2GB card) so it doesn't really run slow for me. The phone has additional features a regular razr does not, like airplane mode, iTunes, and what I like best, software that you can transfer pictures to your phone from your computer (make your own wallpaper!) and can make your own ringtones with. Since D&G designed the phone there are some misspellings in the English lol (like dialled calls, personalise for example). There are times when I don't have signal when I should, but there are also times when I get signal when noone else does (like on the subway) so its a coin toss. All in all I love having th phone. It is definitely for people who love to be noticed and show off, and like having a pimped out phone.\n",

      "I completely agree. This is a trendy phone for those who love to show off. It has some great new features as compared with the older versions of the razr. It's not a PDA or a smart phone and is not intended to be. This is stickly for the fashionistic age, those who want to show of something that not everyone has. As a matter of fact, you won't see anyone carrying this phone where I'm from (MI) and only 2 people have purchased it in the Metro Detroit area so far (me being on of them). So it's rare, and it's nice to have something that no one else has. I love it for what it is. It's way better than the other razrs and the phone mp3 is pretty ok. Especially for the $200 I paid for it. I enjoy this phone and the looks people give me when they see it. So don't buy it if you are into high quality features that a smart phone has to offer, buy it if you want to be flashy and rare! LIKE ME :-)\n",

With that said....this is a designer phone, one can choose to buy a hanes cotton t-shirt for 10 bucks or a D&G with the same feel for 100+ ( same concept applies to this phone  ). If one feels that this phone is out of their price range ( or too expensive ) it's probably because they either can't afford  it, or are quite practical with their money .None the less this  phone can only be appreciated by fans of the designer.  5 stars for design ( i'm bias to this label over all others ).

Firt when you get a voicemail message you will not get a standard alert telling you that you  have a message., You get this blank weird text from '_@' no names, no text just those two characters in the 'from' line., The only way to fix this is to actually download software to hack the phones software itself because tmobile don't go out of their way to fix it or send the updates via text for the phone. Another thing, games from tmobile will not work on this phone, another issue because of tmobile lack of service, but just something to be aware of when buying this unlocked phone. Also when you get this pack ,you do not get the US power charger but rather some asian/euro charger with an adapter. There is also a weird sticker on the box sayng that as soon as you open it motorola no longer are responsible for repairs. Totally weird but anyway...how do you know if you even need repairs unless you open it? I foun this totally insane. I have had no actual damage or problems other than the issues with tmobile voicemail and game functions.I have had mine a few months and haven't had problems with fading, however I do keep it in the eel skin case most of the time.

This phone isn't for you.If, however, you're looking for a functional phone that is attractive and garners a lot of attention from passersby and fashionistas alike, you're in the right place.The Motorola V3i DG is a great phone - it is a RAZR after all. Some people don't like the RAZR because they think it's been played out or overdone, but this phone is unique and has a definite \"cool factor\". The phone's features are a standard late 2005 or early 2006 featureset - there's an MP3 player, a transflash slot, a camera (that could be a lot better, but that's Motorola for you - it's a phone), a video camera, support for real-song ringtones, and a nice set of screens.If you're looking for a device for e-mail, this probably is not your phone. If you like to text constantly and IM casually and you talk often, this is a great phone for you. My one gripe is that the speaker phone is of a low quality compared to the RAZR I had for Verizon. Other than that, it's an excellently-crafted piece of work.I highly recommend this phone (with the awesome-looking DG case).\n",

This phone is excellent in every way. It does everything I require from it and the reception is fantastic, second to none.It opens up PDF files much quicker than the Samsung Galaxy. If you're looking for a nice telephone without the touch screen, do yourself a favor and consider one of the Nokia N series phones - you will not be disappointed. I love this phone and give it 5 stars.I also read that this was the flag-ship of Nokia a few years ago and they sold for anything from $400 - $500 USD when they were 1st launched, so you know the hardware is good. And yes, this one was made in Finland, not Mexico.\n",

      "I have had a Motorola RAZR V3 for years and this is, by far, the best cell phone I have ever had.  I get good reception and it is easy to use and very user friendly.  Some months ago the display went out on my RAZR and I learned they were no longer available.  I purchased a Samsung cell phone instead and it only took a week to determine it was a lousy phone.  I then ordered a Motorola RAZR V3 from Amazon and was ecstatic when my RAZR arrived.  It didn't take me long to return the Samsung.  Recently I purchased another RAZR because my friendly carrier AT&T said my old RAZR that I had purchased 3 months ago had a bad antenna in it and there was nothing they could do.  They said I would have to purchase another cell phone.  I then ordered another RAZR from Amazon and two days later, my other RAZR that was supposed to have had a bad antenna in it started working again.  I now know that AT&T didn't want to admit that it was their tower that was bad, so my RAZR couldn't pick up a reception.  I kept getting a \"Network Busy\" message.  I'm going to keep the RAZR I just received as a backup in case this happens again because I wouldn't have another brand of phone.  I love it!!!!\n",

Let me preface my review by saying I upgraded from a classic design $50 Tmobile Nokia that I bought two years ago and which had no fancy features but served me well. So I decided to go for a Nokia phone again and decided to buy the Nokia 6555 :)My verdict is I think its awesome and I'm very happy with it. It takes great pictures, has a nice interface and is sleek and easy to manipulate (keys are great).Like previous reviewers, I was surprised that the battery doesn't necessarily last a day even with just phone usage since my previous basic phone had a battery life that lasted up to a week. However, after chatting to my friends (who thanked me for coming into the 21st century with my new phone), I discovered that most 3G phones have a short battery life.So in all, I am really happy with my upgraded phone and recommend it to any Nokia fans :)\n",

      "I replaced my Motorola L6 with this Nokia 6555. I liked the L6 except the keys were very small and close together, so I would sometimes hit the wrong key. Also, I had to lock the keys whenever I carried it so a key would not get pressed accidentally. What I needed was a flip phone with slightly larger keys and this Nokia was just the ticket.This cell phone has so many features that I will only list a few. First off, my friend just got a Samsung Blackjack II and this Nokia does almost all the same things that his does. They both have MP3, 3G, Bluetooth, internet access, camera, Micro SD memory ready, organizer, and more with services through ATT. As far as we can tell thus far is the only thing the Smartphones have the Nokia 6555 does not have is Microsoft Mobile Suite. The Blackjack keys are so tiny that I do not know how anyone can use them. Plus, the Blackjack cost much more. The better choice is by far the Nokia 6555.The only problem I am having is navigating the menus to find the settings I am looking for. I have to keep referring to the manual. I suppose after a while I will learn where everything is and memorize most of it.The battery life seems to be about average for a fully loaded cell phone. Maybe some day they will make batteries that last much longer for those power users that complain about short battery talk time. For now we just have to charge the battery more often. Not a big deal for me. If I plan to use the phone a lot, then I simply charge my phone and headset at night to have a full charge on both and I am ready to go the next day. If I do not use it very much, then I only have to charge them about every 3 or 4 days.Pros:Slim and stylish.Good sound quality.Many features.Cons:Menus difficult to navigate.UPDATE:Another con is the backlight only stays on for 10 seconds and there is no way to adjust it to stay on longer.\n",

I check my email with ease and look up sports scores quickly with the touch of a button.

It is sleek and stylish with a lot of features which work well.Pros:  Styling and FeaturesCall quality and signal strengthMicro SD card slotDedicated USB cable portDedicated headphone jack (albeit a small one so you still need an adapter)Pin type connector charger (not the clip on connectors)Cons:  Battery LifeLack of installed ringtones, (correction, see below)Hard to navigate folders and menusI mostly use the phone to talk on and not much else.  I need to charge the battery pretty much every night.  I can go about a day and a half or 2 days if I stretch it.  If you talk a lot or intend to use the other features plan on charging it every night.  In their defense the battery life is rated at 3 hours of talk time and that is pretty much it.  You won't get more than that and like I said you won't get even that much if you do games or other stuff.  The other thing that was kind of disappointing was no ringtones installed except the standard ATT ring. (Correction).  There are a couple of ringtones installed I just wasn't looking in the right folder which is the biggest problem I have with it now.  The music hides in different menu folders and depending which menu you are in you won't see them which is why I didn't think there were any tones at first.  You pretty much have to download anything you want to play.I really like the phone and if the battery would last longer it would be about perfect.  Since all I do is use it for talking and not much else it suits me.I have had this phone for about 5 months now and still really like it.  I am not a tech wiz so I have not even used the music player and other features until recently.  I downloaded some ringtones from a 3rd party website and it was easy.  They play great.  Today I used the bluetooth capability to load pictures from my camera to my MacBook and also loaded a few songs onto my phone.  It was easy for a novice like myself. No compatibility issues.

      "I've had this phone for about 2 months and it provides basic multimedia (pix, camera, audio), reasonable contact functions and fairly good phone quality. I don't use my phone a lot so battery life is acceptable for me. It's not as big or as solid as a Razr, but the price was right -- free with a family plan.The speakerphone could be a little louder.  The menus are ok and are somewhat customizable, and I think better than my inexpensive Motorola.  Switching silent to ring profile is easy.  It also has a flight mode which shuts down the cell phone but allows you to use the multimedia and phone book etc.I got a plastic shell and a leather case that both work fine and protect it as it is a bit fragile.I ordered it from ATT with a handsfree mono earbud which works okay, but is uncomfortable and rubber earbud cushions seem next to impossible to find.  I also have not been able to find a stereo headset with mic.  I tried the Nokia HS-47, HS-42 and HS-40 with no luck.  You can get a 3.5 to 2.5 adaptor, but you won't have a mic.I had no luck with the 3rd party SIM card reader in backing up the address book, but the I did get a data cable that worked.  You have to put it \"Nokia mode\" for the data cable to work right, the data and music mode don't seem to work as well.  Bluetooth worked ok on my Mac, but I didn't try the \"Nokia Suite\" on the mac.  I have not found a video format that will work, but takes most audio files, although some it won't play.  MP3's seem fine.  I added a 1 GB microSD card without any problems.  It has both phone memory and a memory card with is a little confusing.

It's great being able to upload any of my favorite songs to use as ring tones and I love that it came with both head phones, the micro SD AND the appropriate usb hook up. The camera is also amazing, After uploading the photos you can hardly tell that they were taken with a cell phone.My only gripe (and reason for giving a 4 not a 5) is the craftsman ship. Internally the phone is sturdy. It has a great speaker awesome sound quality and user friendly software. It's jut the outside that can't stand wear and tear (especially if you tend to drop things). I've dropped it twice and on the second time it fell face down and the front slide bar cracked (and partially fell off). That feature of the phone still works but the aesthetic is damaged. I had a feeling that it would happen. Protruding parts on the front of phones always end up damaged sooner or later, I wish the company had considered that.\n",

      "Actually, I bought this phone by mistake, since I thought it wouldn't be shipped all the way to Colombia, but it did (in less than seven days). To this point I had only bought books through Amazon and in trying to buy other products had failed due to shipping restrictions, although Amazon and its reseller E-tronics came through this time. Great job guys.Ok, down the brass tax: the Nokia N73 ME is a complete multimedia experience, camera, music player, and yes a phone, complete with all the extras, which led me to sell my old iPod just last week. And since I didn't own a camera, it was fantastic. The camera works great (for a phone), although, you have to become a wiz at adjusting all the settings it comes packed with for your picture to come out great in environments with little light. I'm totally psyched with it, shooting everything that moves. The Symbian OS is well designed and pretty robust, supporting any kind of application you might find.The only downside is that at the beginning it was a little slow while browsing in between applications. But you can fix this problem by downloading the Nokia Software Updater which allows you to update your phone's firmware. I updated my N73 with the latest version (v.4.0727.2.2.1) and the problem was solved, along with dozens of other bugs. And in sync with the Nokia PC Suite it's like having your office in your pocket. Really it is.OK buddy, that's it for now. Hats off to Nokia for making an awesome phone. Your bank account might get pissed off, but your life will most definitely improve: your life in there. Oh, and the best of all is that my childish and unfounded need for the coveted iPhone is now gone. Righty Oh!\n",

      "I've used the N75 phone on Cingy/AT&T; for about a year and this phone uses the same Symbian 3rd ed OS. So I still have the same gripes about that but..The differences that I like on this phone:-Awesome camera resolution. Really digital camera-like. Even the indoor night pictures w/ flash came out great! Most people think it's a camera because of the way it looks and they give you that weird look when you ask them to take a picture of you ... and you hand them a phone!-Better battery life than the N75-I thought I'd have a problem with the smaller keypad area but I can actually text quicker on this because the keys are closer together and more responsive.-the keypad and phone itself (except for the screen) doesn't attract fingerprints as much as the N75-speakers sound fuller and not teeny-more themes and ringtones than my branded N75-lighter than the N75-easier sim card accessThe Cons:-I've gotten used to the flip style so having the screen exposed made me think twice about shoving it into my pockets.-joystick not as easy to get used to.In other words, an awesome awesome phone.A little pricey but well worth it!

They're not as intuitive as the others. However, they're not slow, and I've not run into any bug yet.- The camera is mediocre, but this isn't a cameraphone.

My main reason for purchasing this phone is because I was sick of being tied to certain mobile providers and wanted and a cute and sleek affordable, unlocked phone. This is it. The radio and music player is also a plus even though many phones have those features. What really reeled me in is the that MOTOROKER E8 does not have a keypad with physical buttons. The keypad lights up for your calls and differently for your music. With that feature you don't have to worry about buttons or your whole keypad tearing up like with my previous phones.One last thing is that with this phone and any other phone you can easily scratch it up. For this very reason you will need a case to protect it. Luckily with the seller that I bought this from one was provided and it does it's job.One minor thing.

It does everything that you need in a basic phone for a great price and without all the hassle of buying into a Verison or T-Mobile plan !! I am glad that I bought a RAZR again.

      "I had several reservations ordering this phone after reading so many of the poor reviews. Although Amazon LLC sells the item, it's over one-third more than other sellers. Before buying, I contacted Amazon customer service and they said I would get a full, no questions asked refund if the phone did not work with my SIM card if I used either Amazon or an Amazon Fulfillment seller. So I went for such a seller, less than Amazon LLC but not the rock-bottom cheapest.What I received appeared to be in brand new condition: the box was sealed, and so were all the bags inside. The charger has a US plug but can be used overseas. The battery appeared to be new too, and after being charged under three hours held it for over 36 hours.  The phone was unlocked, but T-Mobile branded. It worked with both my T-Mobile SIM and a UK (English) pay-as-you-go SIM.I wanted a quad band, unlocked GSM cell phone for overseas travel.  This phone fits the bill, and the aesthetics are nice.  Folded, the phone is quite pocketable.  Open, the size is easy enough to manage.  Both the exterior and huge interior screens are color.  The lighted keypad looks like \"Tron\" in its use of a blue florescent design.The owner's manual is quite skimpy and cheaply printed as other reviewers suggest. But I was able to download the full manual as a PDF from Motorola's web site.  The supplied manual is small enough to keep in a wallet while travelling, though.I didn't try sending an MMS, but received one or two of SMS advertisements, so text messaging works.  If you want a phone for overseas travel that will work in almost any country with a local SIM card, consider this one.  As long as you buy from Amazon LLC or use a seller with Amazon Fulfillment, you a) probably will not have any problems and b) will at least get a no questions asked refund with the seller paying return shipping if what you receive does not work as described.\n",

      "As others have said, good for the price, but remember this is a 2G phone.  It WILL be supported for quite some time however by AT&T; despite rumors to the contrary.  I discussed the matter with AT&T; and they said they have so many 2G users they don't dare cut 2G support any time soon.  When that day comes I am sure they will announce it, and there will of course be gnashing of teeth and rending of garments, but at least we'll know about it.That matter addressed, the issue some will have with this phone is that the interface requires a few more key-presses to get to common functions than the more current phones.  Eg: sending a text requires either 5 steps or 7 steps, while other phones require either 3 steps or 5 steps, depending on how you go about things.  For those of us with more recent phones who get this one, these kinds of things will seem a wee annoying until you get used to it.  That said, this phone works and that is what is key to happiness with any product: it's gotta work.\n",

      "I will start off by saying that I have read the reviews of this phone and regarding the seller BSR. I must say that I am shocked at some of the reviews that I have read.Here is my experience with this phone and seller BSR.First off, the Razr V3 is the best flip phone that I have owned till date. The phone that I received worked as the seller has described and looked great considering that it was used. There were next to no scratches or cosmetic issues. The phone came with everything that was needed to use the phone. The phone held a charge and appeared to be fully functional.Here is my experience with BSR Cellular.If you are given the option to buy this phone from BSR, BUY IT FROM THEM. I must also say that I believe that they are the best sellers that I have had the pleasure of doing business with. Due to my ignorance, I purchased this phone without reading the entire ad and to my dismay, it was not for my service provider. I contacted the seller and explained to them my problem and without a single hiccup, they returned my money. That was not the end of it either, they not only returned my money, but also went through the trouble of getting the phone for my service provider and emailed me once it became in stock because at that time they did not have it for my provider and ensured that I received the right Razr for Verizon. This only speaks volumes on their customer service ethics.I hope this review even though it is not in its entirety based on the phone, will help someone in their decision to purchase the phone and whom they buy it from.\n",

      "I ordered this black Motorola RAZR V3 cell phone (U.S. Version) for $47.99 off Amazon.com from a different seller I think, not too sure. It states on the place where you insert the battery, MADE IN UK. Using the phone I went deep into the settings and noticed that the word \"centered\" was spelled \"centred\". No big deal as it is the only one you see and it is way deep inside the phone settings which you will most likely never access again once you are done personalizing your cell phone. From the internet I read that the U.S. version does not have a button located above the wheel but on this phone I got, it does have the button and it's good that it is there because it is a button for prompting delete options of certain things such as text messages, etc. Overall I give this phone a 10.5 out of 10!

Secondly, the sound quality is great which is part of communication. It is very clear and as good as a quality FM radio with no &#34;hollow&#34; sound in the earpiece which is a real plus. The quality of the metallic like dialing buttons is great and has easy to see large glowing blue numbers that are recessed slightly inside the metal keys.  No signs of button wear after 5 years of use. This phone has a strong hinge. A total leather &#34;Made in America&#34; case is still available from Amazon for this phone which will protect it completely from damage in a 6 foot fall and allow the user not to remove it from it's case when making or receiving a phone call. Plus the phone is very nice looking IMO.  There are newer phones out there complete with bells and whistles but I will stay with this phone as long as I can.\n",

This 9000 Bold is the first BB I've owned where I've had to replace my phone three times in the past year due to one malfunction or another.  I purchased mine at AT&T and fortunately all the replacements came within the one year warranty. Although my mute/standby button is starting to fail once again (ugh).  Buying a BB without a warranty I think is foolhardy.  If the iPhone ever had a replaceable battery and multitasking like the BB, I'd probably switch.  The security issue is not that big a concern on the iPhone.  The replaceable battery and the multitasking are big issues for me, so it looks as if I'll stick with BB a while longer and see what transpires with the iPhone 4G when/if it appears.

The phone came in AT&T box which was what the person who helped us to unlock it exactly wanted (he recommended buying AT&T or t-mobile phone because they are more compatible with international phones). So anyway, the phone arrived in excellent condition (although it seems like this was a factory refurbished phone, but it still looked like new). I saw a little scratch on the screen when I unwrapped it, but it turns out the scratch was only on the plastic cover and didn't affect the phone. The only negative was that the back cover (where you put the battry and the sim card) was a little shaky, so I bought one of those protective covers which not only made it more study but also made the phone look more beautiful like new.\n",

I'm constantly on the road checking the progress of construction sites and dealing with real estate agents when they see a potential investment they immediately picture text me the house text me the location.I love how sharp the the Bold looks. The back has simulated leather texture design and its really sleek. Plus it's not super tiny where my thumbs accidentally hit the wrong key when I'm typing emails.The wi-fi makes the internet faster than 3G and the camera is 2MP so it's really high quality.The Bold is a great deal with any carrier and perfect for everyday use.\n",

      "I purchased my Blackberry Bold 9000 (locked from AT&T;) about a year and a half ago, and I've spent much that time learning its features, appreciating its power, and accepting its limitations.I'll try to keep this review simple.PROS:* Excellent VGA display* Terrific stereo sound -- best I've ever heard on a cellphone* Decent keyboard* The Bold series (9000, 9700, etc.) are the very best Blackberrys to date.  Great OS.* Good enough web browser -- once you get used to it.* Wi-Fi performs well.  Less hassle than some other phones.* Fast camera shutter.  Unless your phone is clocking (see below), there is never a lag for photos.* Faux leather back is kinda cool.CONS:* Heavy.  Technology has advanced in the past couple of years, making this phone heavier than necessary.* Expensive.  Seriously, why pay this much for a phone that will be obsolete soon?* Bluetooth is a disappointment.  I want more than stereo headset and hands-free; I want to transfer files.* Phone locks up very often -- at least 3x per day!  It will start clocking for no reason, and sometimes requires a battery pull.  There is no good reason anyone should tolerate this.* As with owning any Blackberry, you are subject to the availability of the Blackberry network.  An outage in Canada will prevent you from using your e-mail in New Mexico.MY RECOMMENDATION:  I bought my phone a year and a half ago, and I'm generally happy with it.  But these days, there are other compelling options.  If you have to own a Blackberry (such as for work), this is your best bet.  However if you are free to purchase something else, consider one of the many exciting Android phones out there.Because, realistically, I don't think Blackberry will be around for more than another couple of years.\n",

      "Blackberry Bold Review: English 015I love the Blackberry Bold! It functions perfectly as a phone and is quick in delivery of text messages and blackberry messages. The web and e-mails are easily accessed and viewed.  In addition, the Blackberry is small and can easily fit into your pocket.  The Bold's keypads lock upon your command so you don't have to worry about \"pocket calling\" people.Within seconds the Blackberry browser connects you to the Internet where you can search for free and it doesn't drain the battery. While on the web, you can download hundreds of applications to your Blackberry Bold such as googlemaps, facebook, skype, etc. Even more convenient, you don't need a digital camera if you have a Blackberry Bold because it contains a digital camera and a video camera. The Blackberry Bold is fantastic because you can use it to send pictures/videos via email, texts, Blackberry messenger, or even upload them to facebook and tag your friends within seconds. Lastly, the Bold won't let you forget a friend's birthday or an important meeting for work. The Blackberry Bold has an onscreen calendar that connects to the alarm and will always remind you of important events.In summation, the Bold does everything required in a phone and more. Right in your pocket, at the touch of your fingers, you can have everything needed to communicate with those around you. Finally, it is slick and stylish!\n",

      "I know a lot of people stated they bought this phone brand new from Amazon and they need to understand that these phones are made for international use which puts the phone outside of the blackberry's warranty. If you buy this phone used, you will see a fake or generic type of battery that was probably used to replace the older battery and sometimes these phones are probably from people trading in their phones for the new blackberries.You have to take into consideration before you buy any international phone that isn't an Apple or Android Product that you will get a generic battery for replacement if you buy this phone refurbished or used. I do agree with buyers who got screwed with the brand new phones. I bought this phone brand new from a 3rd party seller that had the phone sealed and it came sealed with all authentic parts. So I suggest you think about buying from a third party. I do not buy refurbished phones from Amazon because most the time they will have a generic battery on the phone, a returned phone from a customer who ordered through their wireless services which gives you the chance you will get an AT&T; Phone but these phones are unlocked and supposed to be.I suggest you buy from 3rd party sellers that has established positive feedback (I buy from companies that has feedback rating of over 98% and is fulfilled by Amazon). I ordered this phone from Amazon warehouse deals and overall it was well worth the purchase for what I paid for. It cost me 80 bucks for this typical phone which is still popular. The 9930 version is the most popular and still running around 260-280 bucks.This phone is probably one of the best phones that has the best rolling ball in the middle and have good navigation.\n",

      "Hi!I have bough this phone as a birthday gift for my teenager daughter. She has been using it for about three weeks, now. The phone came nicely packed. It was unlocked as advertised, and came with cables, charger and a screen-shield sheet. I could see no scratches on the cover, which fit just fine onto the back of the phone. The phone works pretty fine with Vivo, Oi and Claro carriers in Brazil. Therefore, I induce that it shall work as fine with other GSM carriers around the World. Regarding additional functionalities, wifi works great. Rear camera is only 2 MP but is still good enough to take some pictures (Not a 'Brastemp' camera, though, as they used to say in Brazil. [Note: In Brazil, a 'Brastemp' product or functionality of a product is a regional expression indicating either a product or a functionality of a product that does its job nicely and smooth, and even exceeds expectations). There is no front camera. Web browser is awesome and trackball superb. It comes with several pre-installed applications, and yet one can download another bunch of them. The keyboard is Ok, but as you know, one still needs to get used of it, as keys are small and tightly close each other, and one may miss a key or two while typing faster. Anyway, keypad in resistant. Neither my daughter nor I myself have tried either GPS or bluetooth, so far. You can also add a micro Sd card, which could make a difference if large storage amount is needed.Well, overall, a very good device and it have exactly met my daughter's expectations. So I give it five stars.Peace and blessings.\n",

      "The ONLY gripe I have with this phone/order is that three years ago when I purchased the phone it was nearly twice the price (hey, I love razrs). I have owned more than four different razrs and this one was the best that I had had. Yes they are highly customizable but the interface on this one as well as it's capabilities beat all right out of the gate. Sound quality - in regards to being heard, hearing, and even the ringer were all great. Vibrating function was loud/strong enough. Display was bright enough. The typing input was worthwhile (anyone who has used several phones knows that sometimes you get a phone that you simply can't stand typing on - not all flip phones come with T9) And while traveling up and down the east coast that year I was never without signal. Currently I plan on trying out a straighttalk sim card in this phone when it arrives on thursday.All in all,If you want a nice slim phone and don't need internet browsing or apps, this phone is awesome especially now that it has been marked down. Also, if you simply need it as a back-up phone then what better than something of such slim profile?Of the Wireless Emporium company itself, I had one issue with the order. It has been three years so I can't remember off the bat what it was but it wasn't too big a deal. I sent them an e-mail and they responded promptly.If my current razr breaks again I may plan on purchasing another. And if I do, I certainly have no problem purchasing from Wireless Emporium.-Nico\n",

      "The first couple of weeks with this phone were absolutely frustrating. The response was incredibly slow and it had a knack for freezing. After owning it for the second week, it turned off and was unable to get past the splash screen. What made this so frustrating was how badly I wanted the phone to work. The phone is absolutely gorgeous and I could tell I would end up keeping it for years to come. I searched everywhere for how to fix the problem without sending the phone back. Apparently, this phone's original firmware is very dodgy.If you're interested in getting this phone, I suggest the first thing you do is update the firmware. Here's how I did it.what you need:- LGMulti v3.0 + kf900 DLL here: RapidShare: 1-CLICK Web hosting - Easy Filehosting (refer to[...] for updated link)- firmware here: RapidShare: 1-CLICK Web hosting - Easy Filehosting (check in the firmware list for the latest)- USB data cable- your bricked (stucking on ***** logo) KF900remove the batteryopen USBMap and select infiniteon, then \"mapping start\", and connect your mobile (WITHOUT BATTERY).not sure if I did it in emergency mode or not, anyway if doesn't work simply press send (green) and function (C) buttons togethere while plugging the usb cable.once the computer has recognized your mobile click save&exit.;now open GSMulti and choose the right DLL and .bin files you've just downloaded.click start and wait a while..first it didn't recognize my mobile..I tried unplugging and plugging it in again while pressing send and func buttons and after a while it started uploading the firmware to the mobile.After updating the firmware I found the phone to be absolutely amazing! It's exactly what I was hoping it would be. Sure, it's a little dated in comparison to the newest iPhone etc., but it's extremely attractive and the slide out qwerty keyboard is a huge bonus! After the firmware update I found it to get better usb reception, it works a hell of a lot faster, and never locks up.What I like most about it;-Despite other reviewers, I find the build quality incredible. It feels like something Prada would make.-It's very attractive, especially with the black leather case. Get yourself screen covers to keep it looking mint.-In comparison to the Prada I, the added multi-tasking, better network, wifi access, qwerty keyboard, widgets, and even the fact that I can access all of my media from one button are major upgrades. Access to media from one button sounds small, but it was rather annoying to go to media> external storage> media> images just to look at the photos you put on your micro card. Well, at least for me it was, which I change the wallpaper on almost a daily basis. Also, on the Prada I you couldn't play an album in the media player from your external storage. You had to add songs to a playlist first. Again, I just find the Prada II leaps and bounds above its predecessor.-The images, videos, and music files already installed on the phone are actually quite nice. I found the preinstalled ringtones very fitting of the phone, and decided to use those over ones I personally downloaded. Even the \"sleep-mode\" slideshow you see when the phone is locked is really quite nice.-One of the reasons I bought not only the Prada II, but Prada I, and the LG Vu over the iPhone is because of the UI. On all three, the interface is quite attractive, and the only improve on it more with the Prada II.I'm incredibly happy with this phone, and I certainly suggest anyone looking for a fashion phone to try it out. I've already put money aside for the Prada Link just because of how happy I am with this phone. However, it's definitely a must to update the firmware as soon as you get it.\n",

IT'S GOING TO CRASH!!!  there are tons of discussion boards you can read to find out exactly how to enable the picture messaging and the email over the network of your choice.  when i first got the phone, yes, it was freezing quite a bit.  yes, it was kind of a pain to go through and set everything up manually (your wireless provider in the states won't help you because it's an unlocked phone they don't supply).  but, i went through it (really not as bad as i thought... and i have ZERO experience with this type of thing) and the phone is PERFECTION!if you can grasp basic literacy and a google search bar, you can set this phone up for your provider.  and then you can be the envy of everyone around you.\n",

      "Prior to purchasing this phone, I was confused about whether or not the LG Dare required a Data plan, since many people on this review stated that it does not work without a data plan.  Sonow that I have the phone bought and activated, I thought I would let everyone know what I think is the definitive answer to whether or not this phone is compatible with Verizon's NO DATA plan option.  Here's my experience:- Before I clicked the \"buy now\" button, I called Verizon on the phone to ask.- Verizon specifically stated that this phone does NOT require a data plan.- After I received the phone and tried to activate it online on Verizon's website, the site said \"DATA PLAN IS REQUIRED FOR THIS PHONE.\"- I called Verizon, to ask them why I was getting a message that said \"Data plan required\" when I was told prior to the purchase that a data plan was NOT required.- Here's what they told me:o  Whenever you buy a phone that has the capability to go online, their website automatically asks you to purchase a data plan.  There is an option online that says \"pay as you go\" data plan with no fixed charge, but a fee of something like $2.50 per MB of usage.  If you choose this option, you will not be charged a monthly fee, but you will be charged if you use the phone's internet access feature.o However, if you call Verizon and ask them to disable the internet access feature, you will not only not incur any monthly charges, but you also do not have to choose the \"pay as you go\" data plan.==>> So to make a long story short - after you buy the phone, just call Verizon and tell them that you want to use the phone without any data plan and to disable any internet features of the phone.  And voila, you will have a touchscreen phone with no monthly or pay-as-you-go data fees.\n",

      "Great BASIC phone!! Like many others, didn't want to get a SmartPhone and pay the additional (and required) Data plan. This LG Dare works fine for me. I was kind of leary about getting a \"touch screen\" only phone. I've only used \"hard\" button phones in the past. It's definitely no iPhone BUT...it's a very nice BASIC phone to use. The touchscreen is nice, but I'd highly recommend that you do the \"calibration\" before using it so it will get used to your touch.The only thing that was that when I activated with Verizon, I was told that it could not be used with my current plan (Americas Choice 500 Family Share Plan) and that I had to switch to another plan in order for it to work; which I did (NATIONWIDE LOYALTY SHARE 550 Family Plan) for the same price as I was paying previously. It was a hassle because the original Verizon agent accidentally put me on an Unlimited Talk Individual Plan for twice the price!!As for a few details about the phone:- Screen: Quality seems very nice and locks automatically after a certain amount of time; touch screen works great once calibrated- Keyboard: Obviously it's touchsreen based. For making calls it's easy. Turning horizontally for the QWERTY keyboard, the keys are a bit cramped for me, but I'm getting used to it and it works fine otherwise.- Camera: Good quality for stills; OK for video- Storage: Removable mini-SD card- Ring Tones: Decent selection- Speaker: Loud, sometimes distorts...at high volume of course...but otherwise good sounding. (FYI - When laying the phone down on a flat surface, it muffles the speaker volume a bit since the speaker is on the back of the phone)- Headphone Jack: It's 3.5mm which is great; no need to get a 2.5mm adapter!! 2.5mm headsets are kind of hard to find in the stores.Overall I would definitely recommmend this phone if you are looking for a great, basic (non-smartphone) touchscreen phone.\n",

      "Overall, the LG Dare is a great phone.the most convenient thing about the dare is that it requires no data plan, So you don't have to worry about paying ridiculous amounts of money on the stupid data plan. has a great way of texting fast and easy and has great cell service. The camera is not the best but it's manageable. The setup is great, extremely straight-forward, you don't have to worry about not being able to find something. It has an SD slot, which is extremely convenient when putting your pictures on your computer. Has a great music feature, very easy to load your music onto the phone. The actual problems had with the phone are coming up. The screen and buttons are extremely sensitive, it has massive \"butt-dialing\" problems. For example, you can turn off the phone, but 20 minuets later it'll be on and possibly have contacted someone, no a bad problem i grant you but i still recommend trying to get a case for it. Secondly,has low battery life (which now, that I've come to think of it, could possibly be because of it turning itself on) only lasts 10-15 hrs. And even though this isn't even a real problem, it has a lot of glare on the screen (a screen protecter could cut the glare down). But despite those problems, the Dare is durable, efficient,usable and DOES NOT REQUIRE A DATA PLAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!.\n",

You can store close to about 300 texts and a hugh supply of pictures. it's not a smart-phone, so don't expect a smart-phone. it was one of the first totally-touch touch phones and was pretty much ahead of its time when it first came out. I had purchased the Voyager, but took it back the next day and exchanged it for the Dare because the Voyager gave you the option of typing on either the regular keyboard and the touch-keyboard. I found I perferred the touch-keyboard, thus I went for the Dare.

      "I purchased this phone for my daughter as her last one from Verizon was a piece of junk and broke down.  I have been using an LG Dare myselffor 3 years and love it.  Verizon keeps wanting me to upgrade but I don't like any of the basic phones that are available and they require a$30 data package for the Smartphones which I don't need.  In November my phone fell out of my pocket and landed two floors down on a concrete driveway.The phone stayed on and worked perfectly as if nothing happened.  There weren't even any noticeable scratches or dings.  My daughter is loving herLG Dare and when mine wears out, I plan to replace it with another Dare.\n",

      "I do not need anything but a \"basic\" phone because i also have a Samsung tab for internet.  If you go on the Verizon Wireless site the choices are very limited for what they offer in basic phones.  LG Dare was not on the Verizon website but I found it on Ebay. There are other basic phones that work on Verizon even though they are not being advertised on the Verizon website.I took the so called \"required\" data plan which allows access to weather and news etc and that is cool.  I just read another review by a Dare user, however, that says that if you contact Verizon directly they will turn off internet features and you will not need a data contract. I like to have it though.I have a hearing problem but the Dare is so clear and loud that i can hear fine on it, a big plus for me.  I love the touchpad and good camera and you can set your favorite photos as wallpaper.  There are many wallpapers and themes to choose from and you can download additional Weathercast or Games and I downloaded Scrabble and card games. There is a small charge for these. There are also numerous ringtones and you can sync music from your computer onto the phone. You even have your choice of size and type of font.I have had my Dare now for about 8 months and never had it freeze, nor a dropped call.  I have called long distance from Canada with very clear reception.  I am going to get a spare Dare just in case something happens to this one.  Verizon wants to get everyone to upgrade to a higher data plan which all Smartphones require, but i am sticking with this really solid basic phone for a long time.  Meets all my needs and I love it.\n",

      "The LG Dare was my first smartphone and I loved it until I \"graduated\" to an even smarter phone, and gave the Dare to my husband, who had tired of his old phone. Recently, his Verizon contract came up for renewal, whereby he was eligible for a new phone at a discounted price (with a 2-year contract of course), but he refused to give up his Dare, in spite of its being all beat up (he had chosen to not use screen or phone covers while he had it). He was adamant about keeping his Dare, saying it did all he wanted it to do, it was the right size and feel, etc., etc. He also did not want to spend the extra money on a data plan he wasn't going to use (we both have plenty of computer access otherwise) so a smartphone was out.  Since I'm the \"geeky\" one in this family I did the research on feature (aka \"dumb\") phones he might like, and unfortunately the pickings were quite slim...it's obvious that the phone companies, or at least Verizon, are moving towards having very few feature phones, if any.  Desperate, I came to amazon--which is where I come first whenever I want to buy something. Not expecting to find it, I looked for and found the Dare through this seller.  The phone appeared to be brand new and we immediately had it activated at Verizon without any problems.  Plus: my husband is not locked into a 2-year plan! This time my husband agreed to a case and screen cover which I also bought through amazon.  My husband is very happy with this purchase,and I hope it will last him at least a couple more years. I should mention that the phone IS internet capable if that's something you do want. The only reason I am giving this item 4 stars is because the cover on the SD slot of the phone was loose.  My husband played around with it finally getting it to fit it, but we're not sure what will happen when he needs to open it again, if it will open or if it is stuck, etc.  This won't be a major problem since more than likely he won't be using the sd card on the phone for his pictures.  I complained to the seller about this and received a response within 24 hours.  By then the problem had been solved by my husband, but I appreciated the seller's willingness to help and satisfy me, the customer. So, the problem is not with the seller, but with a small defect of the phone itself.  I would not hesitate to buy again from this seller, and who knows, maybe in a few years my husband will want yet another Dare!\n",

      "Got this thing in late 2008.  Verizon completely screwed up the firmware and software that came from LG.  Spent 2 weeks at the V-store until they finally got it to work like it should have when shipped. Three years later, after heavy use-abuse, this thing was working like a Rolex.  When it started to freeze (about every 4-6 months) that was a reminder to \"dial *226 and update me, stupid\". Voice commands and recognition were incredible.  Call clarity was superb. And the virtual QWERTY keys were huge with great tactile learning.  Then I left it outside in the rain all last night. After spending 2 hours on Verizon's web site, I now realize there is no phone on the planet that does what the Dare did without a data plan. Did I mention the ORIGINAL battery kept this thing going for 5 days on a single charge as of yesterday?  Try getting that out of ANY smartphone.Verizon wanted this phone to disappear ASAP because they knew it was a smart phone killer. You could do email and internet and GPS if you wanted to, and it was $10-15 a month extra.Lastly, the camera took excellent stills and decent video, the speakerphone was incredibly loud, and I had 40 picts and 130 texts stored in it and it NEVER said I had a memory shortage.Gonna miss this sucker bad...\n",

      "This phone is great. Touch screen sensitivity is not overly sensitive and you don't have to press to hard. I have this phone for about a week, and even though it did not come with a manual, i was able to figure it out easily. I bought this phone because I wanted a touch screen phone that didn't require a data package. The 3.2 mega pixel camera is outstanding. The phone comes with 7 cool animated backgrounds and several ringtones. If you want your own ringtones and wallpapers, I suggest myxer.com. They will send it from the internet to your phone. Another thing that I like about this phone is that contacts are easy to add. You can customize the layout of this phone by simply dragging and dropping, which is very easy to do. Virtual qwerty is easy to type on, I rarely hit he wrong key. Music player is great. all of my previous phones have had 2.5 mm headphone jacks which are pointless. This has a standard 3.5mm which means your iPod headphones can fit. The screen is easy to unlock, all you have to do is tap the lock icon in the bottom left of the screen.Pros- good touch screen, good calling, good qwerty, customizability, camera, easy to add contacts, good tools such as  calculator, stop watch, tip calculator, and my favorite, the drawing pad.Cons- space bar on standard keyboard is not in normal spot, (positioned more towards right side), videos can only be 30 seconds longAll in all, this phone is great for everyone, I am a teenager who constantly texts and listen to music, but it is not too complicated, because my mom can operate it.\n",

      "One of my two current 2 year old LG Dare cells is not working correctly. So I spent hours online researching for a different replacement that did not required a data plan. That was pretty much a waste of time. There aren't any with similar bells and whistles that don't have a QWERTY keyboard. Since I have no need for the keyboard, that only makes the phone thicker and less simple to operate. So I guess you could say that I'm a repeat customer.PROS: Nice size and bright screen, easy to operate after some self training. Excellent manual of instructions. Speaker volume is good. Sound quality is above average but probably won't impress audiophiles. You can use bluetooth or plug in an external headset/mic. Batteries are inexpensive and readily available. Not as bulky or thick as most smartphones (but still won't fit in a standard cell belt pouch).CONS: Even with a nice sized screen it is hard to see in bright sunlight. There are one or two places in the phone where the letters you need to press for a specific operation are in mice type. Not a lot of ring tones and you can't download them without a data plan. You can attach them to a text message tho.Two minor nuisances with this phone: 1- It has a resistive touch instead of a capacitive one. That means you will need a bit more pressure (or finger nails) to get the icons to work. 2- The battery case is a b**** to get off without breaking it.Unless you decide to go Smartphone and pay the data cost, I don't think you'll find a more convenient cell that the Dare.\n",

I mean one guy complained (in Spanish) his didn't arrive by Christmas time....Touch sensitivity- Its fine. If you think its insensitive you might be the weakest person on earth. They also make less sensitive phones for a reason, you don't want your pocket making calls to china.User friendliness- Every icon represents the app or directory correctly, its also easy to change the settings. If you have problem with this you might have a severe case of ADD or have never used a cellphone before. Butterfingers as well.Response time- If you have complaints with the response time, go be a Jedi, you probably can see things before they happen.messaging and calling- all that is expected of a phone.From what I've used, I have no complaints for this phone.For those who wrote those negative reviews. This phone might have been bad before but now (2011) Its good, your reviews shouldn't hinder other people from a good phone or in my case waste an eff load of time deciding.\n",

      "UPDATE - 3-12-2013 - Still have this phone at 3 years and it still works great!To start with, I've had this just one week so far & for basic/casual use only. Will not use it for the 'net & haven't tried the camera yet. Edit 4/15 - I like the camera, it works great & pics are clear, with fun editing options. With that said, I absolutely love this phone! It has the functions I was looking for and more. It has many features all explained in detail in the thick booklet it comes with...thanks to LG...I suggest reading it thoroughly with phone in hand to check it all out. It has lots of -helpful tips- & many features with detailed information.It came with a charger for 100-240v and an adapter that fits well. It's all you need to charge in the US or in other countries. More accessories are included but I suggest -not- trying the screen protector they added separately since it has residue AND it's a bit thick which would make the touch screen less responsive. Also ---> the phone already has a screen protector on it when you take it out the box (the right kind of protector for touch screen), so if you look closely you can tell it's there and no need to remove or replace it. Just wipe clean when needed.This phone looks a lot nicer then it appears in the pic shown. It has good quality hardware and easy to hold on to, not slippery. The touch screen looks really nice & is very responsive & brings up the menu or whatever you need quickly. Mine does anyway, and there are settings for every thing (I do mean every thing) so you can adjust to your preference. Easy, intuitive, & has many features that make it so nice and capable of doing a lot.Edit (4-11-10) -- Someone else reviewed saying they could only listen to music with the headphones, but... that's if you start from the widget. If you access your music from the entertainment section instead, you can play it loud and clear w/o the headphones & the info as well as cover art appears on the screen. :)The side scroll bar takes some getting use to but it works well after practicing a bit. Edit 4/15 - sliding the bar from fingernail works better. The backlights longest time for inactivity is 60 seconds, but you can just press the on/off button once and it will be back on & in the same screen/function you were using. That's all minor stuff imo. I got more then I expected for the current price and with a year warranty from cell concepts (ordering directly from Amazon), it is a great deal in my opinion.I use T-Mobile and pay as you go service. I find this phone to be reliable & -not- a cheap quality cell that the phone companies offer w/o a contract. An unlocked 'non-branded' phone is much better then a phone directly from the phone companies & retail stores. What I mean by non-branded is, for example, AT&Ts; name is not on the hardware, only the manufacturer...like LG is on this phone. I have had an LG flip phone for the past 6 years & it still works, I just wanted to try a newer more functional phone and this one is very nice.\n",

      "It was really the best value for you buck... I had looked around a lot in different sites and definitely the amount of features this phone has for this price was great, not to mention it is an unlocked phone so I didn't have to get in a contract again. Believe me, carriers treat you so much better when you are not in a contract!I had read in reviews that T-Mobile multimedia messages were not compatible with this phone, and it was a bit of a appointment to find out it was true. However, if you go to the T-Mobile support forums and use LG KP500 as keyword, you will find out how to program your phone to send and receive multimedia, as well as being capable of browsing the web and use e mail.Life battery is good: My days start at 7am and sometimes en as late as 11pm or even later on fridays... I talk and text a lot, and not run out of battery. It comes with a USB adaptor which also charges the battery, so I keep that one in my office in cas I forget to charge at night.\n",

      "Lo mejor de este telefono es su precio... en realidad muy bajo con respecto a otros que son mas sencillos..Al inicio es un poco dificil el uso de la pantalla tactil pero en unos pocos d&iacute;as termina uno por acostumbrarse.Lo bueno:1. La duracion de la bateria.2. El tama&ntilde;o.3. El material, no se raya con facilidad.4. La memoria expansible.5. El puntero.6. Mutitarea, puedes tener abiertas varias aplicaciones.7. Si te registras en la pagina de LGMOBILE, puedes bajar bastantes juegos. Como recomendacion, si vas a registrarte hazlo como si estuvieras en espa&ntilde;a de lo contrario no vas a encontar informacion ni aplicaciones. Luego baja los juegos y aplicaciones desde el telefono, no desde la pagina ya que por la pagina tiene que ser por medio de SMS.8. El cable USB, te funciona como cargador.9. Pantalla Tactil.Lo malo:1. El envio de mensajes, es un tanto dificil, si estas acostumbrado a enviar mensajes SMS constantemente y de manera rapida, este modelo no es para ti, es un poco complejo. inclusive con el teclado QWERTY.2. No guarda registro de ultimos numeros a los que le has enviado mensajes, por lo cual a la hora de buscar el destinatario te lleva mucho tiempo.3. Si tienes muchos contactos se dificulta a busqueda.3. No tiene funcionalidad de copy paste.4. La camara no tiene auto focus, es casi imposible tomar una foto clara.5. No tiene Flash6. Tanto el cargador, el USB y los audifonos poseen una sola entrada y no es comun. Si se te pierde alguno de ellos veo dificil encontrar el sustituto.7. Los audifonos no son de muy buena calidad, es plastico duro, por lo que es incomodo en los oidos y muy propenso a quebrarse.8. Las tapitas de las entradas de el micro SD y del cargador, son muy debiles, si constantemente estas cargandolo o conectando los audifonos pronto se te van a quebrar y van a quedar al descubierto.9. El boton de bloqueo no esta en la mejor posicion y esta muy cerca del disparador de la camara.10. Cuando te indica que queda poco carga en la bateria, no te ha pasado ni una hora cuando ya se apaga, y el aviso es muy constante y molesto..11. Si bien la pantalla es grande no puedes hacer que las cosas se vean mas peque&ntilde;as por ejemplo el texto de los SMS, con el tipo de letra mas peque&ntilde;o es facilmente leible por alguien que este a un metro de distancia.En resumen el telefono tiene sus detalles malos, y sus atractivos, yo en lo personal le he tomado el gusto, y sobre todo porque por su precio no encontraras otro con esas caracteristicas.\n",

The touchscreen is just a little slow sometimes but as you get used to the phone it becomes \"normal\" for the user.  For those who get their batteries to last only 24 hours, decrease the display brightness to 40 and always set it on power save mode and you will get approximately 2 to 3 days without recharging the battery.

      "I bought this phone from amazon three days before thanksgiving. It arrived the day before neatly packaged and undamaged (brand new) in the box. At first I was not familiar with all the functions and keys but I spent the night figuring everything. Right out of the package I inserted my sim card, battery and the phone fired up right away.Pros:Good size phone with a good solid feel. I especially like the feedback from the screen when you touch or use the stylus which folds neatly into the bottom of the phone. The package includes a transparent cover for protecting the screen. Do not be put of by earlier reviews! It does have all the MMS features found on other phones. I loaded the included software and from LG's site, I was able to download the newest firmware update which speeds up the phone and opens all the features. The latest software is kp500_v10o. Calls sound good and i was able to text, browse and e mail with a few adjustments in the software. There are several web sites out there with configuaration info and there seem to be droves of people who like this phone.......you cant beat the price for what it does and how good it looks.Cons - It should come with more apps but i will remedy that very shortly,this is a minor nuisance. One other thing, LG USA does not have any information nor will they help with the phone even though it bears their name. I could not get help to access the USB driver from them. Thanks to the many \"friends\" in cyber space i was able to find it in short order.I ordered the case, a protective cover and a extra screen protector because i plan on keeping this as long as i did my last phone..........5 years. Times are hard and the rent is too damn high.....can't replace phones every few months like some folks!I highly reccomend this phone if you are in the market.\n",

So I was looking for a slightly better, more sophisticated phone. A semi-smart phone. This Cookie fit the bill perfectly. Its only slightly larger than the Motorola L7 and actually fits in the L7's case. I was apprehensive about buying this phone because it received a few really bad reviews. I took a chance and I'm GLAD I did. The only complaint I have is, in order to answer the phone several separate finger strokes are required. The instructions could be better but are for the most part adequate. The phone is fairly easy to navigate and intuitive. The camera isn't to bad (I haven't used the video yet). My only big complaint is if you store your phone book info in the phone as well as the SIM Card the phone book info is listed twice on the phones display. I would like to have WI-FI but I knew this feature was missing. I don't have a data plan so I can't say how well it surf's the web or how easy or difficult it is to read your eMail. I paid $133.00 for this phone and one week later it went on sale AGAIN for $99.00. Im very pleased with this phone even though I paid $34.00 more than I could have if I had procrastinated. You can listen to your music using the built in speaker, however if you use the radio feature you'll need to use the supplied earbuds because the antenna is in the earbud wire. Its a nonstandard plug, BTW. I now need reading glasses and you can magnify your \"Phonebook\" which is convenient but sadly none of the other displays can be enlarged. I've taken pictures of my family and friends and assigned their photos to their phone numbers ( the instruction book is weak on describing this feature) so when they call their picture pops up on the display. I would definitely buy this phone again.\n",

      "I've had the Cookie for about a month now and I am so happy with my purchase!It was fully charged when I received it and all the mentioned items were in the box, including the charger with adaptor.  I slipped my SIM card in (I have T-Mobile Even More service) and it immediately recognized T-Mobile as the carrier; even shows it onscreen!Spent approximately 20 minutes playing around with the settings as they are organized a bit differently from U.S. phones...for instance, the settings for ring tones are under the \"Settings-Profile-Normal\" names, not the usual ones we see here.  However, it's pretty easy and the touchpad appears to become more responsive with time as you get used to it.The QWERTY keyboard is great and the accelerometer function works quite well for typing with either [small] fingers or the stylus.  People have received my texts promptly, as I have theirs.  Anyone considering this phone would do well to check the services their provider offers - if you don't have an Internet plan, well, the phone won't surf the 'Net - I say this because I've seen a couple of complaints about that issue.  I don't use my phone for that purpose, just calls and texting, and it's perfectly suited for such.  Also, this is NOT a wi-fi or 3G equipped phone, which again suits my needs but perhaps not others...they'll have to spend a bit more for that and sacrifice battery life.  Speaking of battery life, I am a fairly heavy talker and only charge my phone every 3-4 days - and it charges in less than a couple hours.All in all, if you're patient and like to fiddle with new gadgets as I do, you will LOVE this phone.  The wallpapers, ringtones and games are really great and again, I'm extremely happy with my little Christmas present to myself!\n",

Customizable screens.  Responsive touch screen easy to get used to after a little bit of practice.  Integrated stylus pen for times when you don't feel like fat fingering.  And nobody has mentioned this before, but this phone comes built-in with lots of language input support.  I like to text my friends in Korean, and this phone allows you to both send and receive text in Korean many different languages.  No Samsung phone on the market in the U.S. (except the newest $650 Galaxy S) allows you to do this (and believe me, I have looked really hard).

      "I first started looking towards unlocked phones because my contract with T-Mobile had expired and I refused to purchase internet access on a mobile phone ... it would cost me more than my house internet!  Anyway, I wanted a mobile phone with a keyboard, a touch screen and something $100.00 USD or less.  After extensively looking for a couple of months, I decided to give this phone a shot.I have now had this phone a month.  I purchased the 'Genuine Gold' color phone, but the only difference between this and that phone are the shell colors.LG KP500 Cookie Unlocked Phone with 3.2 MP Camera, Quad Band GSM, TFT Resistive Touchscreen, and Accelerometer Sensor for Auto-Rotate--International Version with No Warranty (Genuine Gold)First, I was quite impressed with the size and look of the phone.  It is small; about the size of a wallet and much thinner and lighter.  There is a stylus pen at the base of the phone.  The instruction booklet that came with my phone was not only in English; it also had a multitude of other languages.  The flip side of this is that the instructions in each language weren't very detailed and honestly, I could have used a bit more help.By default, the wall charger is a non-US plug, but there is an adapter to use in the US.  There is also a cord to go from the phone to the computer (USB).The phone itself is pretty much limited to calling and texting.  I knew the camera was nothing to write home about, and my expectations were very low for this camera.  This is good-- since even though this is the highest MP camera I have ever used in a mobile phone, it takes (by far) the worst pictures of any camera phone.It takes a little fiddling, but the phone has to be manually set up to accept/send MMS (picture messages) with T-Mobile.  (check the T-Mobile user forums for the correct setup).  As someone else has pointed out, T-Mobile texted me some instructions on setting up MMS messaging, but after three weeks.  I didn't switch; there really is no need to.  (Officially, T-Mobile doesn't support this phone, so why they would care how the phone is set up is beyond me!)The pictures tend to be small, but as I noted earlier, I am using this for phone/text and this doesn't matter to me.The most aggravating thing about this phone is the amount of time it takes to 'tilt' to the landscape mode while texting.  Rarely it's fast; most of the time it's okay and a few times I get aggravated and manually change the keyboard myself.  Another note on the keyboard-- I have regularly-sized fingers and yet still use the stylus since when I try to type, I usually hit the wrong letter.Since this is an international edition of the phone and not a US version there are some minor changes:--Dates are presented in DD MM YYYY format;--The ! key is hidden under the second level keyboard characters, but there are other characters I've never seen before now: a 'W' with a line through it is one example.--The word 'dialing' has been spelled 'dialling'.I must say that the color on the screen is absolutely wonderful; one of the top two phone screens I've seen.  I really was (pleasantly) surprised by this.I do recommend this phone for others looking for just a phone that texts and dials.  If you are looking for an internet phone, I would not choose this one.  However, I would choose this mobile phone all over again.\n",

Call quality is also very good.I love the touchscreen! I won't go back to a non-touchscreen phone after this. It's so much easier to navigate through the menus and get it to do what I want. Yes, texting is a little more difficult. But, all the positives of the touchscreen outweigh that negative. And, I text quite a bit.I have At&T; in the U.S. and I was able to get MMS and internet services to work right away. Just do a Google search for LG Cookie MMS settings AT&T.; There is a lot of info out there on how to set it up.The phone is very thin and lightweight.

      "This phone is nothing short of amazing!  I'm a huge skeptic of touch screen phones, but this is nothing I expected, thankfully.  I've had the phone for about 2-3 weeks and it hasn't failed me at all.  The touch screen configuration works excellent for making on-screen buttons that you press accurate. It's not too small or too big (a little smaller than an Itouch). The memory slot for a 4g is phenomenal.  It allows me to put as much information as I'd like, without effecting the internal memory, or decreasing the performance of the device. The ringer volume is Very Loud (I can hear it on the first floor when I'm on the second in my home). The radio is crystal clear and from the apps to the natural functions of the device, it is surprisingly fast.I have T-Mobile and their devices usually don't have good coverage in different areas.  This phone, actually has a stronger coverage area and I can get signal better than on my associate's G1.  Where he looses signal, I still have full strength.  The battery life is impressive, especially the feature that saves battery power when the phone isn't in use.  It also holds great signal when synced to a Bluetooth headset.The only flaw I found is that I wasn't able to access the full capabilities of the internet browser.  I can only access Yahoo.  Then again, I don't have internet in my plan so this particular feature is open to interpretation of other users lol.LG KP500:  5/5\n",

      "This is a nice little phone.  It slips easily in your pants pocket for guys.  Although it has extensive support in the UK, unfortunately there is none here. You can enhance some features by going through a UK proxy server, but that is quite a bit of work.  If you travel to the UK and get a UK sim card, I would imagine all the toys and widgets can be downloaded there.With T-Mobile prepaid service MMS does work, once you get the settings correct (find on the net), but mobile web does not, except for T-Zones.  Once you have MMS working, T-mobile will eventually push their preferred settings to you (It took them three weeks), but with the new settings, no change in performance was noted.With AT&T; prepaid (GoPhone) service, MMS does not work (due to AT&T; support problems, not the phone), but Mobile web does ( most of the time) - again once you find the correct settings on the net - forget about AT&T; support.This is not a 3G phone - but it supports the 4 commonly used bands for Edge and voice services though, so it should work everywhere.As others have noted, the adapter is a euro plug with a US adapter - not a big deal.Also note that the calculator is set for UK settings - Imperial gallons - not US etc.  The calendar is set for the Euro standard of Monday - Sunday (that was the 7th day wasn't it?), but you can change it to Sunday - Saturday.The camera shots for are a little fuzzy, so don't expect great pictures.All in all a good little compact phone that beats a candy bar phone.  No pocket bulges or camera case needed on your belt with this jewel.Update 1/12:  This phone is now getting long in the tooth.

      "I travel frequently back to the UK so this phone works great for me. It is quad-band and GSM phone which means it has a removable sim card that I can use a pay as you go sim card when I go back to the UK, and then switch it back while back in the US. Unfortunately your limited to AT&T; or T-Mobile in the US as the other carriers don't use GSM phones, not sure why?.  The phone itself which I bought in the UK has an adapter for 110/220v for charging in other countries which is a nice touch from LG (I once fried a US adapter by plugging it into a UK socket, duh!). It comes with a screen protector and the casing feels nice and not too cheap. The touch screen itself is bright and easy to navigate and the inclusion of a stylus that fits in the base of the phone makes it very handy when texting. The phone houses a slot for a micro SD card up to 8gb, which is ample for mp3's and photo's or video's. I don't like that you have to use the supplied headphones in order to listen to music as they aren't that good and would have preferred the ability to use third party phones.Camera quality isn't that great, but like most phone cameras the quality is grainy, I only use it rarely as I have a good quality digital camera for that.  Overall it's a great little phone that is considerably cheaper and less bulkier than the i phone. And if you need accessories then eBay is the place to go, I picked up a great leather case that fits perfectly, and a car charger. I have had the phone now for 7 months and am pleased with it so far.Update: I recently flashed the phones firmware to the latest version which is V10n and the phone is so much better.The touch screen works a lot better than before and the slide bar can now be used without having to press hard.The firmware install is a little tricky and can only be done on a windows operating system, but is well worth the time as the phone's performance is so much better.

      "I got this phone cause I wanted a touch phone and I'm on a budget, so I chose this instead of the Samsung S5230. I've got to say it was a smart move, this phone is much cheaper and it has pretty much the same functions. The construction quality is very good and the unit comes with a screen protector so you don't leave your fingerprints all over the screen, which obviously will happen a lot.Luckily it also has a stylus pen, as text messaging with the virtual querty would be mission imposible without it, I have small fingers and had a hard time trying to hit those small buttons so the pen came in handy.Pros:- Small- Lightweight- Nice bright screen- Good menues, customizable- Touch screen is pretty responsive- Comes with stylus pen (you'll need it for text messages)- Features acelerometer- Good volume and quality MP3 player- Bluetooth- Navigation runs pretty fast- Battery life is goodCons:- Manual could be better, misses some useful information- Photo Camera is not very good (don't be fooled by the 3MP)- Some basic things are complicated to configure (like ringtones)- LG propietary connection for headphonesThe camera quality is far from stellar, but you can't ask a cellphone to take great photos, specially at this price point.I've owned another LG phone (MG 280) and it turned out to be the worse I had, I even promised myself i would never buy another LG, but clearly after seeing this one you can tell these guys evolved a lot and listened to their customers on many common issues with their previous phones.All in all, the best $190 you can spend on a phone today, sure there are better, but none of them below this price. If you want something good and don't want so spend too much, this is by far the best option you've got. I took one star off just for the camera and the headphone connection, but no doubt this product is solid.\n",

The cell phone itself is very light weight and slim as compared to other phones having similar specs. It has been over a week now and I am very pleased with the performance of this phone.PROS :- Lightweight and slim- Touchscreen works absolutely fine.- Speaker volume is sufficient.- International support (using it in Asia..)CONS :- Camera could have been better.- Not recommended for messaging.I have previously owned a Samsung phone which had a 1.3 MP camera and the results were 5 times better than the 3.2 MP camera of this LG KP500 phone. I guess you get what you pay for. But above all this is a great touch screen phone for a price around $100 that I bet you cannot beat.

I was hoping to get the european adapter, but did not, oh well they are cheap to pick up anyway.I have a Motorola Droid; the size and weight of the cookie is great, its smaller and lighter than the droid. I tested my 16GB micro sd card from my droid in the cookie and it recognized the size even though other reviews here and specs say it only takes a 8GB card. That may have something to do with the firmware version update. One thing to note that i didnt see in any reviews here is to make sure you turn on the phone when its plugged in via USB to your PC or it will not recognize the phone...lolI put in a 3 year old Wataniya sim card and it recognized it right away. Altough I havent used this phone yet, I am more than confident that it will perform flawlessly for me in the near future. Im still playing with all of the functions and options of the cookie, so I cant really comment on that yet.

      "So I have at&t; and I had the LG Neon for a bout a yea and 2 months and the screen died on me so i got this as a replacement phone. I had that kind of anxiety about whether or not i was gonna choose a good phone and if it would be good atleast out of the box but I was actually pretty happy with this purchase and I'm happier now.The phone basically acts like a smartphone but without the 3G or WiFi which kinda upset me but its a budget phone so you can't be too picky when your on a budget. What i love the most has to be the multitasking. You can listen to music and text at the same time along with a bunch of other things. I love the minimal amount of buttons because of course its a touch screen. And the built in stylus is pretty handy as well.Now i read reviews about bad music quality over the included headphones and touch screen being non responsive. But in my experience the music isn't actually that bad. I'm not the kind of person that craves that brilliant quality so it didn't really matter to me. However, it did surprise me because it really isnt as bad as people say it is. The touch screen might not be as responsive as the Iphone or Itouch but its a standard touch screen, its not that bad either, keep in mind this is a budget phone. I sometimes have problems with the on screen keyboard but its just something i can get used to. I sometimes use the stylus and it works great tht way too.Overall I'm pretty satisfied with my purchase and if the phone fails, well I'll just buy another one since i got this for less than $100. Or atleast until my contract is up at the end of this year :)\n",

There is a lot of info out there on how to set it up. The phone is very thin and lightweight. I wear jeans a lot and it fits in the front pocket nicely. So, if you don't need 3G, GPS, or WiFi, this is a really great phone. If you do, then I'd look elsewhere. But, for me, it does everything I need, and does it well. I've had this phone for about a month now, and I'm very impressed with it. It gets great reception, even better than my old V3 RAZR, which I thought had excellent reception. Call quality is also very good. I love the touchscreen! I won't go back to a non-touchscreen phone after this. It's so much easier to navigate through the menus and get it to do what I want. Yes, texting is not perfect, but doable. But, all the positives of the touchscreen outweigh that negative. And, I text more than I want to admit.  overall,  I recommend the phone if the price is discounted some for the older technology.\n",

I must say, either my phone was a fluke because everything worked great out of the box, or there are a lot of people out there looking to spend $100 and get a $500 phone! This phone is easy to navigate and set up, has a nice touch screen (I love the included hidden stylus!), and has a lot of features some higher priced phones didn't. The pics and video are exactly as listed - this is a phone, NOT an SLR camera. The pics seemed perfectly acceptable to me as it is listed as a 3MP camera. Also, I read a lot about the quality of the mp3 player..??!! It's a phone first and foremost. The sound quality to me is equal to my son's Ipod touch using the same earbuds. Bottom line for me is that this phone cost less than $100, everything works just fine for me (MMS and data using T-Mobile), and the added features rival that of higher priced phones of the same age.\n",

She originally wanted a Iphone, but I didn't want to switch carriers an didn't want to risk a getting one for her that someone unlocked as we don't live in the same area...

My work has Tmobile and is very cheap with getting us the actual phone, for that mater I have had the same work phone for over 6 years!

The touch screen is fantastic, the camera is okay, the music playing system is great, the additional stylus pen (I don't really use it)is okay, and the opportunity to expand memory is unbeatable. The downside is that you can't really use the web or set up an e-mail (no wi=fi), and the phone is a bit slow loading your entire music/pictures, and multitasking is nearly impossible.

      "Upon receiving the item unboxed it and went through the list of what's included in the box and found out that the stereo headphone is missing. I then contacted Amazon.com, through email, about the missing piece, got a reply asking me if I want to send the LG KP500 Cookie back to them for a full refund but decided to keep the unit without the headphone. Amazon.com offered me $16.60 to be credited to my account as a token for the missing part. Two days after it was credited to my account. Amazon's customer service is excellent. I will keep ordering items from this guys.Anyway, I've read good reviews of this item and ordered it in replacement of my Palm Treo 680. I still like my Palm Treo for what it can do but sad to say it needs to retire. I was going to order the same item (Palm Treo 680) but decided to try and go with a touch screen. The LG KP500 Cookie unlocked cellphone is in excellent condition. I inserted the sim card and took it for a test drive. The touch screen is very responsive, colors are vivid and true to life. No complaints about this item. Good price, nice looking touch screen phone.\n",

      "I have been looking for a new phone for the last year, since my old T-Mobile Blast was becoming outdated. So, when I took a trip to Germany and found the LG KP500 there, I was quite curious. I looked up reviews here on Amazon, and after some consideration, bought the phone from a German electronics retailer... And I am sure glad that I did!Let's get started with the Pros and the Cons of this phone.PROS:-Unlocked, Quadband World Phone.-Inexpensive. I bought the phone for 89, which is comparable to the price here on Amazon.-Good Quality. Although the phone is small and made of plastic, it has an extremely durable feel.-Signal Quality. I normally have no signal with T-Mobile's To-Go plan in my house, but I usually have at least 3 bars with this phone. By comparison, my last three phones constantly lost signal in my house.-Great features. Many features, including a Movie editor, 3MP Camera, Music Player, Video Recorder, Games, Accelerometer, and drawing pad.-Stylus. Not really necessary, but it really helps with texting and making notes.-Multiple Apps and Task Manager. You can run more than one app at a time, like Music Player and Camera-Widgets. On the home page, there is a selection of widgets to choose from. These include: Music Player, World Clock, Clock, Calender, FM Radio, and Notepad.-Speed Dial Widgets. With a swipe of the finger, the home page changes to a speed dial home page with up to 10 contacts and images.-Downloadable Apps and Games. The phone is Java based, so you can download .JAR apps from a number of sites to transfer to the phone.-Expandable Memory via microSD slot (Up to 8gb)CONS:-The interface, while very sleek and refined, can become slow due to multiple apps running at once.-Texting in QWERTY format is a bet annoying at first, due to the small keyboard. But after a while, you get used to it.My recommendation: If you are looking for a new, unlocked phone at a cheap price, the LG KP500 is for you.NOTE: I own the silver version of this phone, which doesn't have the rubbery texture.UPDATE 10/2010-The phone is still working great. I actually received an update from T-Mobile to allow MMS messaging and internet web-browsing, so the phone is actually better now than it was 6 months ago! Plus, after accidentally dropping it face first into concrete, it still works with no scratches! So that is another plus!\n",

      "I am extremely happy with this phone.  I have always used a button type phone and was hesitant about buying a touch screen.  I use the stylus alot especially when texting and it is extrememly fast to text now over the old push this button 3 times and push this one twice on the old style phones.  The picture taking is decent not awesome but it is good if you have forgotten your regular camera.  It has a movie mode also, and some cool photo editing software.  The screen is very clear and easy to read.  I had trouble with my Blue Ant working correctly with other phones but it works really well with this one and for the first time people can actually understand me when using it. I have had alot of phones the last one I had was a Razor which I returned, as it was good for nothing.  This one has been great, and I have had it for about 2 months.  I have not used it with an internet service.  I would buy this for a friend if I was looking for a good gift phone\n",

      "- Overview: if you are looking for a very nice phone that could just replace your small appointments notebook, and you don't need wifi, GPS, applications, etc., this phone provides an excellent value.- On-screen keyboard: you will need to have a little patience at first with the onscreen keyboard, but you get used after some days. You can choose between a full keyboard or the small one, and you can also activate T9 predictive text in several languages. After some practice, you can write pretty fast (as fast as any iPhone user).However, if you have big hands you may need to use the included pencil for more precision.- Usability: colors are great. It has very good usability, and well organized screen menus.- Battery: the phone needs a charge every three or four days, approximately (take into account I'm not a heavy user).- Size and weight: the right size (not too small, not too big), and very low weight.- Call reception: I'm presently using T-Mobile in DC. I have always good reception, more than the one I get with my motorola/AT&T; work cell pone. No dropped calls so far.After a couple of weeks with it, I'm really happy and highly recommended it.\n",

      "I've had this phone for about a month now, and I'm very impressed with it.  It gets great reception, even better than my old V3 RAZR, which I thought had excellent reception.  Call quality is also very good.I love the touchscreen!  I won't go back to a non-touchscreen phone after this.  It's so much easier to navigate through the menus and get it to do what I want.  Yes, texting is a little more difficult.  But, all the positives of the touchscreen outweigh that negative.  And, I text quite a bit.I have At&T; in the U.S. and I was able to get MMS and internet services to work right away.  Just do a Google search for LG Cookie MMS settings AT&T.;  There is a lot of info out there on how to set it up.The phone is very thin and lightweight.  I wear jeans a lot and it fits in the front pocket nicely.So, if you don't need 3G, GPS, or WiFi, this is a really great phone.  If you do, then I'd look elsewhere.  But, for me, it does everything I need, and does it well.\n",

      "I was devastated when my beloved pink Samsung Star smart phone died after less than a year of use. The screen wouldn't respond anymore and getting it fixed would cost about $60-100, the price of a new phone, so I took the leap and bought the Cookie instead.As someone who has used a touch screen phone for a while, I'm not too impressed by the features of the LG Cookie. If this is your first smart phone, you won't notice the shortcomings. This product does give you quite a bang for your buck. Its best feature is probably its camera and photo editing functions. For those of you who like taking pictures with your cell phone, the image touch-up tools are very advanced and plentiful.However, I use this phone mostly for texting, calling, and organizing daily events--areas in which it has been a let-down. I loved the texting feature on my Samsung Star that automatically shifted the keyboard so that it would be horizontal (like that of a computer/laptop), but the Cookie's motion sensor is very poor and it usually takes me a few tries to get the sideways keyboard to pop up. According to my boyfriend, the call volume from my end is very poor (a big problem because we're hundreds of miles apart). Lastly, the calendar widget is very similar to that of the Star, but it has way too many fields that require input before you can finish entering a simple event.Those of you who like widgets will be a little disappointed as the Cookie has a minimal attitude towards displaying superfluous applications. The games that came with the phone were visually appealing. There is a good array of ringtones to choose from, but the wallpaper/theme selection is sparse. I really like the video camera function, which I don't recall being present in my old Samsung.\n",

      "I ordered this phone when my beloved but ancient Treo finally died. I didn't want to extend my contract with my carrier to get a phone I didn't particularly want, so went the unlocked route. The Cookie stood out quickly, for its look, functionality, and price.I am very, very impressed. It's nearly weightless. The design is sleek and beautiful. The screen is huge, bright, and clear. Sound quality is good. There's a handy button on the earphone cord that allows me to answer or hang up without touching the phone. Texting is easy, particularly once I turned off interpretive typing and discovered the landscape keyboard. The stylus is neatly integrated into the frame, although since I have small hands, I don't always need it (someone with larger hands will find the stylus essential).It has a slew of applications and utilities I haven't yet explored - calendar, memos, music player, FM radio, video, voice recorder, etc. I'm sure they will work well, given how efficiently the basics operate.All in all, this phone is great looking, has a lot of attractive features I wouldn't expect in such a reasonably priced phone, and I'm delighted with my purchase!\n",

      "I'm an 18 y/o ready to head off to college and while I don't use internet on my phone, I send up to 50ish text messages a day to my girlfriend/friends.I'm looking at this mainly as a texting phone with some extra features. I could have gone with a basic model (my other option was basically the Samsung B3310 but that's more of a kid's phone and it didn't appeal to me), but decided to try something slightly flashier.I had my doubts about the touchscreen for texting but I'm MUCH faster after just a day. I realize that the phone won't compare to a hard qwerty keypad or to a high quality capacitive touch screen (iPhone or Droid), but once you're used to it, it does the job well. The phone isn't perfectly fast but you don't have to wait more than a second for anything to load (as long as you don't burden the home screen with a shortcut to hundreds of image files).Great mid-range phone. Not 5 stars because there are better, but I'm convinced that it's the best in its price range. MMS was easy to set up, and I'm sure internet is too (not a feature I use).Also, T9 is a great fast way to text if you can't use the qwerty keyboard. The texting does lag a little bit but if you're looking for a perfect device you won't get it for $100 flat. I have BEAR CLAWS for hands, though. It took some getting used to but mistakes are almost nonexistent now. If you hate learning new things, this isn't the phone for you, but give it a week and some experimentation and you'll be fine.No idea how it'll stand up to long term use in terms of bugs and hardware failures, but most people complain about the features rather than bugs. Like other users, I have noticed words being deleted, now that I think about it. I didn't even notice at first, I suppose, and I think it may have something to do with the predictive feature on the qwerty keypad. An accidental touch could easily blank out a field.\n",

I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS AS GREAT GIFT.updated January 12/2012Still have my phone. Still love it and its still working, although not as perfect as it was when I 1st got it but its working nonetheless. The only thing I would say the owner should watch for and that is because it's happening to me.  Once you drop it a few too many times (and dropping it means by mistake not intentionally) it tends to cut off by itself at any given time. Also if you close it to hard it will shut off too. But like I said, that only happens when mistakenly dropped so don't let it drop. Other than that this is a dam fine phone and I love it. I know there are other up to date phones out there but when you find something that can take a licking and goes on ticking it's a keeper because it's become immune to abuse (LOL).\n",

      "I made the leap into the smartphone world, coming off an old flip-LG phone that I *loved*.  I wasn't sure I'd even really like the BlackBerry, as it's a bar phone and I always chose flip models, but I love it.  Sure, the Javelin doesn't have 3G, but for most things, the EDGE network is perfectly fast and 3G isn't so much faster that I miss it for web browsing.Call Quality - in all honesty, I don't call much on the phone, but it gets plenty loud and I can usually hear calls just fine.  It doesn't drop calls unless my service sputters (ATT), but overall I have no complaints.Keypad - On this, I'm much pickier.  I love the QWERTY keyboard on this model.  My work phone is a BlackBerry World Edition 8830, whose keys are much more similar to the Bold and Tour.  I don't like those keypads as much.  There was, of course, a slight learning curve on the Javelin in typing time, but now typing is a breeze.  I type an awful lot on Gchat, via SMS, and via BlackBerry messenger, and I have no problem with the keys.  They're great, they're separated, and I don't often make a mistake on them.Trackball - I cannot praise this trackball enough.  RIM finally did away with the old recessed trackballs and created one that feels smooth and effortless.  I love it.Media player - I didn't actually expect to use this, but I lost my mp3 player.  I popped in an 8 gb microSDHC card (didn't have to remove the battery - nice feature), loaded up some music, and popped in earbuds.  Music doesn't sound so phenomenal that audiophiles would be happy with it, but to me it sounded perfectly acceptable.  Videos and pictures look spectacular on the display, and there's a playlist option for music.  All in all, pretty impressive for a phone meant for email.Display - Gorgeous.  Absolutely flawless.  Pictures look amazing, it's a pleasure to look at the screen.Connectivity - Again, no 3G on this device.  Unless you need to use data while talking on the phone, you won't miss it.Speaker - LOUD.  Not awesome sounding, but better than most mp3 players' built in speakers.Reasons why it gets 4 starts instead of 5 - MicroUSB, why?  Why remove the miniUSB that SO much of my other electronics have?  I hope I don't lose the charger . . . It can be a little laggy occasionally.  It's tough to find good accessories for this particular model.  It was $150 with a contract, why no accessories?  It should be much easier to find a good skin and screen protectors.All in all, the device is fantastic.  It's smaller than the Bold and the Tour, the screen is outrageously good, and it's a pleasure to type on.  I'd highly recommend it.\n",

      "Good Morning. I live in Venezuela, and I buy this phone with many expectations, and I was not disappointed. It is a mini laptop phone, he has all the tools to keep you well informed and connected to the Internet. The emails arrive in real time, has speakerphone, bluetooth, GoogleMaps, and one modest gps. Great expandable memory, keyboard perfect, neither too large nor too small. The resolution of your screen is phenomenal. The 3.2 megapixel camera has autofocus.The only detail, if you use the internet much much like the facebook mobile upload photos, and the messenger, because the battery only lasts 1 day. In no other complaints.Purchase a longer battery life and be happy.It has many applications, I can open PDF files, I think I need only get applications to open compressed files.The size and weight are ideal. If more light would give the feeling of being poor, if not heavier than many believe is outdated and is made with materials global warming.The agenda is amazing, very intuitive.The trackball is strange at first, but 3 days and ends becoming familiar atmosphere.It's the best phone I could buy, and  amazon offers the best price and with free shipping.Here in Venezuela, is the best for the blackberry messenger, we Venezuelans are more accustomed to SMS messages.100% recommended.Greetings\n",

Circumstances forced me to change from Sony-Ericsson to Blackberry and I do not regret the change. The size and weight are great, and the keyboard is even easier to type on than what I thought. The design is stylish, and the screen resolution is pretty good. I'm also amazed with the amount of apps available for Blackberry. I had no problems connecting to wifi, and I haven't had any major issues at all after a bit more than a year of usage. I'm a bit disappointed with the battery life, but I run IM+ on my Blackberry, so I guess that's probably linked. Overall I'm happy with my Blackberry.\n",

    "On the second approch, we focus only on reviews according to a brand.\n",

    "1. First, we split the reviews according to the grade (5 groups from 1 to 5).\n",
    "2. **Topic modelling**: with words vectors and LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) approach: reviews are seen as a bag of words, and topics as a distribution over a fixed vocabulary. Words are generated from document specific topic distributions. As the output of this step we have 10 topics with 10 most import words for each topic (for each brand).\n",
    "3. **Tag a sentiment on topic words** : We use the previous Sentiment Analyzer to get a weighted sentiment for the topic.<BR>\n",
    "We consider two kind of words:\n",
    "    - Feature words (which is one phone feature like battery, price, etc.)\n",
    "    - Non-feature words (all the others, including 'great', 'bad', 'awesome', 'problem', etc.)\n",
    "All the non-feature words which are on the topic will be sentiment analyzed. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. The weighted scores of all the non-feature words will be given to all the feature words in the following topic. If a topic not contains feature words, we simply skip it.\n",
    "5. At the end, we group the results to get an overview for all the reviews (all grades) : we count the density of appearence for each feature words in topics, and we also show the sum of polarity scores for each feautre word."
